    The following paths are checked in order (first found used):
    - `path` (section `[tool.{name}]` or data in the whole file)
    - `.{name}.toml` in the current directory
    - `pyproject.toml` in the current directory
    - `.{name}.toml` in the project root (if `vcs=True`)
    as defined by `git`, `hg`, or `svn`
    - `pyproject.toml` in the project root (if `vcs=True`)
    as defined by `git`, `hg`, or `svn`

    Warning:
        Automatically returns __only__ the relevant configuration
        of the linter.

    Args:
        name:
            The name of the tool to search for in the configuration file.
        path:
            Explicitly provided path to the configuration file, if any.
            If not given, `tooload` will try to guess based on `directory`
            and `vcs`.
        directory:
            The directory to search for the configuration file.
            If not provided, the current working directory is used.
        vcs:
            Whether the version control system directories should be
            searched for when localizing the project root.

    Raises:
        ConfigMissingError:
            If the `path` is specified, but the file does not exist.
        TomlDecodeError:
            If any of the files were found, but could not be read.

    Returns:
        Configuration dictionary of the tool or an empty dictionary.
