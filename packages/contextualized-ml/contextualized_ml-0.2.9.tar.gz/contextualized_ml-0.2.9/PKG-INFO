An SKLearn-style toolbox for estimating and analyzing models, distributions, and functions with context-specific parameters.

Context-specific parameters:
- Find hidden heterogeneity in data -- are all samples the same?
- Identify context-specific predictors -- are there different reasons for outcomes?
- Enable domain adaptation -- can learned models extrapolate to new contexts?

Most models can be contextualized. For example, [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Formulation) is
```math
Y = X\beta + \epsilon
```

Contextualized linear regression is
```math
Y = X\beta(C) + \epsilon
```
where the coefficients $\beta$ are now a function of context $C$, allowing the model to adapt to context-specific changes. 
Contextualized implements this for many types of statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian networks, correlation networks, and Markov networks.

For more details, see the [Contextualized Machine Learning whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11340).

## Quick Start

### Installation
```
pip install contextualized-ml
```

Take a look at the [easy demo](docs/models/easy_regression.ipynb) for a quickstart with sklearn-style wrappers.

### Build a Contextualized Model
```
from contextualized.easy import ContextualizedRegressor
model = ContextualizedRegressor()
model.fit(C, X, Y)
```
This builds a contextualized linear regression model by fitting a deep-learning model to generate context-specific coefficients $\beta(C)$.

### Predict Context-Specific Parameters
```
model.predict_params(C)
```

See the [docs](https://contextualized.ml/docs) for more examples.
