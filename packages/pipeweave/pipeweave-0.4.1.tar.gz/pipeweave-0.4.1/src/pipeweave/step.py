class Step:
    """A single step in a data processing pipeline.

    A step represents a single data transformation operation in a pipeline.
    When part of a stage or pipeline, a step typically receives input from
    the previous step's output, creating a natural data transformation flow.

    For independent operations that need to work with the original input data,
    it's recommended to:
    1. Place the step in its own stage
    2. Use explicit dependencies (when supported)
    3. Create a separate pipeline

    Attributes:
        name (str): Name of the step.
        description (str): Description of what the step does.
        function (Callable): Function that implements the step's logic.
        inputs (List[str]): List of input names the function expects.
        outputs (List[str]): List of output names the function produces.
        dependencies (Set[str]): Set of step names that must execute before this step.
        state (State): Current state of the step.

    Example:
        >>> step = Step("double", "Double input", lambda x: x * 2, ["num"], ["result"])
        >>> result = step.execute({"num": 5})
        >>> print(result["result"])  # 10

        This method runs the step's function with the provided input data.
        When part of a stage or pipeline, the input data typically comes
        from the previous step's output, creating a natural data flow.

        Args:
            data (Union[T, Dict[str, T]]): Input data for the function.
                Can be either a single value or a dictionary mapping input names to values.
                If a dictionary is provided and there's only one input, the value is extracted.
                In a pipeline, this is typically the output from the previous step.

        Returns:
            Union[R, Dict[str, R]]: The function's output.
                If the function returns a dictionary, it is returned as is.
                Otherwise, the output is wrapped in a dictionary using the first output name.
                This output will typically be passed to the next step in the pipeline.

        Raises:
            Exception: Any exception raised by the function is propagated up.
                The step's state is set to ERROR in this case.
