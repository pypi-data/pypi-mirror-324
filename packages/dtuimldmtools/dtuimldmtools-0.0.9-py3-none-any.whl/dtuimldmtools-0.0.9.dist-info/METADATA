# DTU 02450 Toolbox

This package includes helper functions to be used with exercises material of the 02450 Introduction to Machine Learning course at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Check the [course homepage](https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02450/) for more information.

## Installation

```
pip install dtuimldmtools
```

## Included data

#### body.mat
This is a subset of the dataset on body dimenstions available at http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/courses/STA3301/resources/Data/ 
and described in 
G. Heinz, L. J. Peterson, R. W. Johnson, and C. J. Kerk, “Exploring relationships in body dimensions,” Journal of Statistics Education, vol. 11, no. 2, 2003.

#### faithful.mat and faithful.txt
Dataset on eruption of the Old Faithful geyser described in
A. Azzalini and A. Bowman, “A look at some data on the old faithful geyser,” Applied Statistics, pp. 357–365, 1990.
W. Härdle, Smoothing techniques: with implementation in S. Springer, 1991

#### female.txt and male.txt
Data is taken from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/names/,
Please consult the accompanying readme_male_female.txt file in the Data folder.

#### iris.xls
Fisher's Iris data, for a description see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set. The data has been downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.

#### nanonose.xls
This data has been taken from the nanonose project, see also http://www.nanonose.dk, it is described in 
T. S. Alstrøm, J. Larsen, C. H. Nielsen, and N. B. Larsen, “Data-driven modeling of nano-nose gas sensor arrays,” in SPIE Defense, Security, and Sensing. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2010, pp. 76 970U–76 970U.

#### StopWords
A txt file of list of common words provided in the TMG toolbox.

#### textDocs.txt
This example of documents for a term-document matrix is taken from 
L. Eldén, Matrix Methods in Data Mining and Pattern Recognition. Philadelphia, PA, USA: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2007.

#### Wine.mat and Wine2.mat
P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547–553, 2009.
downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
Wine2 is same as Wine but with some outliers removed.

#### zipdata.mat and digits.mat
USPS handwritten digits availabe at http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/MLData.html, see also

#### wildfaces.mat and wildfaces_grayscale.mat
Taken from http://tamaraberg.com/faceDataset/ and described in Tamara L. Berg, Alexander C. Berg, Jaety Edwards, David A. Forsyth 
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2004. 
The wildfaces.mat is an extract with 1000 examples of the original dataset and wildfaces_grayscale a gray scale converted version of these 1000 examples taken from the original data.

#### messy_data.data
This dataset is an excerpt of the Auto MPG Data Set which has been heavily formatted to introduce comming data preprocessing isusues.
Revised from CMU StatLib library, data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg 
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
