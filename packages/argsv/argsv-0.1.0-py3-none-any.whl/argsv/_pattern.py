This file is about Patterns.
Patterns are templates that can be used to specify,
in the form of a dictionary or kwargs,
how each argument should be validated.
Pattern keys must be the names of parameters of
a callable and their values must be a callable or validator.

The Pattern class is implemented so that patterns
are specific objects that can be worked with in
a more convenient and controlled way.

    The Pattern class is responsible for creating Pattern objects.
    Objects that can bind validation patterns to arguments
    by referring to parameter names to make the
    validation process more specific and orderly.
    Pattern objects are created by default in the 'ArgsVal'
    class for validating arguments.

        dict   --> {"parameter_name": Validator | Callable}

    Pattern objects have a method called 'match' that
    checks their match with a callable.

    Also, using a method called 'get_validator', you can
    get the validator by referring to the name of the
    parameter to which the argument is sent.
