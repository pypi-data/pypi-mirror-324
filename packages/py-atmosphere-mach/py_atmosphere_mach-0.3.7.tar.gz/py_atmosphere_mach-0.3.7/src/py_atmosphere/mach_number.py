def mach_number(altitude, alt_units, speed):
    """
    Calculate the Mach number of an object moving at a given altitude.

    Given an altitude, and assumptions of air composition, this function calculates the speed of sound in m/s in 
    specific altitude using the formula: speed of sound = c = sqrt(gamma * R * T), where `gamma` and `R` are 
    standard air properties, and `T` is the temperature at the given altitude. Then it calculates the Mach number 
    of an object moving in said environment.
    The ratio of specific heats, gamma is 1.4.
    The gas constant R is 287.1 J/kg/K.
    Celsius to Kevin: Celsius + 273.15.

    Parameters:
    ------------
    altitude : float
        A numeric value that represents the altitude of interest. This value is the reference to extract air properties, specifically, temperature, pressure and density.
    alt_units : str
        Units of the altitude input to function. Valid units are: m (meters), km (kilometers), ft (feet), miles (miles).
    speed: float
        Speed of the object in m/s.

    Returns:
    ---------
    float
        The Mach number (adimensional) in specific altitude, calculated as: speed / speed of sound as calculated in speed_of_sound function.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> mach_number(0.0, "ft", 340.4)
    1.0
