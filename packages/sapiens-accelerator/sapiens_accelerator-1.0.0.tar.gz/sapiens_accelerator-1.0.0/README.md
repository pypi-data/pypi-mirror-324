Code library for communication between Sapiens Transformers and Sapiens Machine.

# Sapiens Machine

This set of algorithms was developed by Sapiens Technology®️ and aims to accelerate the processing of language models through optimizations mediated by the Sapiens Machine library. The two packages work together to accelerate hardware and optimize software, making training and inference possible on modest computing systems and improving performance on high-end hardware.

## Installation

Before installing the main package, it is necessary to install the scipy package as a dependency.

```bash
pip install scipy
```

Or install the recommended version:

```bash
pip install scipy==1.15.1
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Sapiens Machine.

```bash
pip install sapiens-machine
```
