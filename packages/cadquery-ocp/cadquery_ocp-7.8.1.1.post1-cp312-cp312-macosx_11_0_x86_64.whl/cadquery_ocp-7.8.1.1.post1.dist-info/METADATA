# cadquery-ocp (also known as OCP)

Python wrapper for OCCT generated using pywrap. Typing [stubs](https://pypi.org/project/cadquery-ocp-stubs/) available from pypi.

## Goals of OCP
* Provide thin bindings to OCCT.
* Wrap all OCCT modules (if practical).
* React quickly to new OCCT releases.
* Cater primarily for the CadQuery project.

## Non-goals
* Provide additional functionality not present in OCCT
