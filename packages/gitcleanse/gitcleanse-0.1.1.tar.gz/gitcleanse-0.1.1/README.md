## Prerequisites

Before using the application, ensure you have:

-   **Python 3.8 or higher:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   **GitHub Personal Access Token:**
    -   You can generate a token by going to your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    -   The token needs the `repo` or `public_repo` scope (depending on whether you need to access private repos).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pouyashahrdami/GitCleanse.git
    cd your-repository
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file which includes all the libraries, in your case `rich` and `requests`)

## Usage

1.  **Set your GitHub token:**

    -   **Environment Variable:** Recommended method. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to your personal access token.
      -   **Linux/macOS:** `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`
      -   **Windows (cmd.exe):** `set GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`
      -   **Windows (PowerShell):** `$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_token"`
    -   **Direct Input:** If the environment variable is not set, the application will prompt you to enter your token at the start.
2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  **Follow the on-screen menu:**
    The application will present a menu with the available actions. Enter the corresponding number to perform a specific task.

## Menu Options

-   **1:** Analyze current relationships (mutual followers, non-followers, etc.).
-   **2:** Unfollow non-followers (users who don't follow you back).
-   **3:** Follow back your followers (users who follow you but you don't follow back).
-   **4:** Discover and follow followers' followers (with a user-defined limit).
-   **5:** Analyze user activity (show details about user contributions).
-   **6:** Display detailed user information (about the current user).
-   **7:** Generate network report (not yet implemented).
-   **8:** Display user dashboard (key metrics and insights).
-   **9:** Automated User Engagement (configure and perform automated actions).
-   **q:** Exit the application.

## Automated User Engagement Details
The Automated User Engagement feature allows you to configure the following actions:

-   **Star New Repositories:** Automatically star new repositories created by users in your network.
-   **Like New Commits:** Automatically like (add +1 reaction to) new commits made by users in your network.
-   **Comment on Issues/PRs:** Automatically comment on newly opened issues or pull requests in your network using a customizable message.
-   **Follow Back Users:** Automatically follow back users in your network that you're not following.
-   **Rate Limiting:** All actions respect GitHub's rate limits with sleeps between API requests.

## Configuration

-   The application reads the GitHub token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
- You can configure various aspects of the application via the on-screen prompts including:
   - Filter users by minimum or maximum number of followers or repositories.
   - Set the maximum number of users to follow in the `Discover and Follow Followers' Followers` option.
   - Enable or disable automated engagements.
   - Set the comment message when commenting on issues or pull requests.
-   You can provide a default value to the `ask` function in `ui/prompts.py` if you would like to make it easier to use the application.
