## About the project
VueGen automates the creation of reports based on a directory with plots, dataframes, and other files in different formats. A YAML configuration file is generated from the directory to define the structure of the report. Users can customize the report by modifying the configuration file, or they can create their own configuration file instead of passing a directory as input. 

The configuration file specifies the structure of the report, including sections, subsections, and various components such as plots, dataframes, markdown, html, and API calls. Reports can be generated in various formats, including documents (PDF, HTML, DOCX, ODT), presentations (PPTX, Reveal.js), notebooks (Jupyter) or [Streamlit](streamlit) web applications.

An overview of the VueGen workflow is shown in the figure below:

## Installation

You can install the package for development from this repository by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -e path/to/vuegen # specify location 
pip install -e . # in case your pwd is in the vuegen directory
```

This will both install `quarto` and `streamlit` as our backends for report generation.

### Verify quarto installation

Test your quarto installation by running the following command:

```bash
quarto check
```

If you use conda a conda environement you can install quatro from the conda-forge channel 
in case it did not work.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge quarto
```

## Execution

Run VueGen using a directory with the following command:

```bash
cd docs
vuegen --directory example_data/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook --report_type streamlit
```

> ðŸ’¡ If `vuegen` does not work, try `python -m vuegen` instead.

By default, the `streamlit_autorun` argument is set to False, but you can use it in case you want to automatically run the streamlit app.

It's also possible to provide a configuration file instead of a directory:

```bash
vuegen --config example_data/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook/Earth_microbiome_vuegen_demo_notebook_config.yaml --report_type streamlit
```

The current report types are streamlit, html, pdf, docx, odt, revealjs, pptx, and jupyter.
