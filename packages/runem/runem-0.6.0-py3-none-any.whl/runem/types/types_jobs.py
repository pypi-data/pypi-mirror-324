"""

Some note on Unpack and kwargs:
    We *try* to strongly type `**kwargs` for clarity.
    We have tried several ways to define a Generic type that encapsulates
        `**kwargs: SingleType`
    ... but none of the solutions worked with python 3.9 -> 3.12 and mypy 1.9.0,
    so we have to recommend instead using:
        `**kwargs: Unpack[KwArgsType]`

    For this to work across versions of python where support for Unpack changes;
    for example `Unpack` is a python 3.12 feature, but available in the
    `typing_extensions` module.

    So, for now, it looks like we get away with importing `Unpack` from the
    `typing_extensions` module, even in python 3.12, so we will use, and
    recommend using, the `typing_extensions` of `Unpack`, until it becomes
    obsolete.

    Alternatively, we can use the following, but it's unnecessarily verbose.

    if sys.version_info >= (3, 12):  # pragma: no coverage
        from typing import Unpack
    else:  # pragma: no coverage
        from typing_extensions import Unpack
