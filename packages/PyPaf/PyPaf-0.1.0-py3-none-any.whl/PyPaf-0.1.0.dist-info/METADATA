# PyPaf

Formats the elements of a Royal Mail Postcode Address File entry according to the rules described in the [Royal Mail Programmer's Guide Edition 7, Version 5.0](http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/programmers_guide_edition_7_v5.pdf)

## Installation

Install it from PyPI:

    $ pip install pypaf

## Usage

May be used to format the PAF elements as an array of strings:

```python
from paf import Paf
paf = Paf({
    'building_name': "1-2",
    'thoroughfare_name': "NURSERY",
    'thoroughfare_descriptor': "LANE",
    'dependent_locality': "PENN",
    'post_town': "HIGH WYCOMBE",
    'postcode': "HP10 8LS"
})
paf.list()

['1-2 NURSERY LANE', 'PENN', 'HIGH WYCOMBE', 'HP10 8LS']
```

Or as a single string:

```python
from paf import Paf
paf = Paf({
    'building_name': "1-2",
    'thoroughfare_name': "NURSERY",
    'thoroughfare_descriptor': "LANE",
    'dependent_locality': "PENN",
    'post_town': "HIGH WYCOMBE",
    'postcode': "HP10 8LS"
})
str(paf)

'1-2 NURSERY LANE, PENN, HIGH WYCOMBE. HP10 8LS'
```
