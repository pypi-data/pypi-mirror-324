## YAML
name: monologue_to_prompt
prompt: >
  You will receive a long, possibly disorganized description (“monologue”) of what the user wants. Your goal is
  to read this monologue thoroughly and then produce a single, clear, and optimized prompt that accomplishes
  the user’s stated objective.

  Instructions:
  1. Focus on the user’s ultimate goal: extract critical details and requirements from the monologue.
  2. Remove extraneous commentary or irrelevant tangents.
  3. Organize the information into a structured and concise prompt that an LLM can easily follow.
  4. If specific instructions, constraints, or desired formatting are implied by the user, incorporate them clearly.
  5. Maintain clarity, brevity, and relevance.

  Output:
  Provide only the final, optimized prompt. Do not include the original monologue in your response.
