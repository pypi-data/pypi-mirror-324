"""Webson Module

This module provides the main functionality for the Webson package,
which leverages the IntelliBricks framework and Playwright to transform
raw webpage content into structured data using an underlying Language Model (LLM).

Key Components:
    - Webson: The main class offering methods to retrieve webpage content and "cast" it to a structured format.
    - Asynchronous and synchronous methods: Use Playwright for headless browser automation and IntelliBricks for LLM integration.

Usage Example:
    >>> from intellibricks.llms import Synapse
    >>> from webson import Webson
    >>>
    >>> # Create a Webson instance with a Synapse LLM
    >>> llm = Synapse.of("google/genai/gemini-pro-experimental")
    >>> webson = Webson(llm=llm, timeout=5000)
    >>>
    >>> # Retrieve the HTML content of a webpage synchronously
    >>> html = webson.get_contents("https://example.com")
    >>> print(html)
    >>>
    >>> # Cast the webpage to a structured data model
    >>> import msgspec
    >>> class PageSummary(msgspec.Struct):
    ...     title: str
    ...     description: str
    >>>
    >>> summary = webson.cast("https://example.com", to=PageSummary)
    >>> print(summary)
