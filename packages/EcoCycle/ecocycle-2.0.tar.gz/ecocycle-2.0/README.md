# EcoCycle - Cycle into a greener tomorrow.

Our program was originally developed for the Lenovo and Intel's EDUtech ASIA hackathon, under the sustainable campus theme.

Through deliberation, we decided to create a functional program for proof of concept. Thus, the EcoCycle program was born.

# The EcoCycle program: 
- Uses user profiles for personalized stats
- Has a password-protected admin page that displays a summary of total distance, total price, pedal point balance. 
- Has a user summary page. 
- Has a booking page allowing users to place orders for free rides. 
- Displays the Carbon Dioxide offset by EcoCycle and by each individual user. 
- Displays the total calories burned for each journey. 
- Follows proper procedure for scalability by ensuring all def functions have their relevant #explanations and names# allowing for mass scalability if needed.
- Has the appropriate RESET protocols for use after debugging.

The following parts of the program were written with the help of LLM's:
- Full Google Sheets integration with a concise graph displaying the effect of the distance on the CO2 footprint.
- Weather forecast integration.
- Travel time estimator with real-time traffic and weather conditions.
