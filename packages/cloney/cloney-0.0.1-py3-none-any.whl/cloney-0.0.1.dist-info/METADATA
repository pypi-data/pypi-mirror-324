# Cloney - Storage Migration CLI

Cloney is a lightweight command-line tool designed to migrate files between different cloud storage providers seamlessly. It supports AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Alibaba Cloud OSS, and Azure Blob Storage, allowing you to move data efficiently.

## Features

üîÑ Migrate files between S3, GCS, OSS, and Azure Blob

‚ö° Fast and efficient transfer with minimal configuration

üîß Simple CLI usage for easy automation

‚úÖ Supports large file transfers

üîê Secure authentication using environment variables or config files

## Installation

From Source (Python)

```sh
pip install cloney
```

## Usage

### Same Cloud Transfers

Migrate data within the same cloud provider:

**AWS S3 to AWS S3**

```sh
cloney s3 my-source-bucket s3 my-destination-bucket
```

**Google Cloud Storage to Google Cloud Storage**

```sh
cloney gcs my-source-bucket gcs my-destination-bucket
```

**Azure Blob Storage to Azure Blob Storage**

```sh
cloney azure my-source-container azure my-destination-container
```

**Alibaba Cloud OSS to Alibaba Cloud OSS**

```sh
cloney oss my-source-bucket oss my-destination-bucket
```

### Cross-Cloud Transfers

Migrate data between different cloud providers:

**AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage**

```sh
cloney s3 my-s3-bucket gcs my-gcs-bucket
```

**Google Cloud Storage to Azure Blob Storage**

```sh
cloney gcs my-gcs-bucket azure my-azure-container
```

**Azure Blob Storage to Alibaba Cloud OSS**

```sh
cloney azure my-azure-container oss my-oss-bucket
```

If you would like to create the destination bucket automatically, use the `--create-destination-bucket` flag:

```sh
cloney s3 my-source-bucket gcs my-destination-bucket --create-destination-bucket
```

## Authentication

Cloney supports authentication via environment variables or configuration files:

### Linux/macOS

**AWS S3**

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/gcs-key.json
```

**Alibaba Cloud OSS**

```sh
export OSS_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
export OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

**Azure Blob Storage**

```sh
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

**AWS S3**

```sh
$env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
$env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**

```sh
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\gcs-key.json"
```

**Alibaba Cloud OSS**

```sh
$env:OSS_ENDPOINT="your-endpoint"
$env:OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
$env:OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

**Azure Blob Storage**

```sh
$env:AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string"
```
