"""
Turtle-based graphics library for drawing various shapes centered on the
cursor.

turtleBeads.py

In general, these functions draw things centered at the cursor, and put
the cursor back where it started afterwards. Set the pensize and pencolor
before drawing a shape to control what is drawn. For most shapes you can
also use fillcolor and begin_fill/end_fill to fill in the shape.

This module also causes built-in turtle commands to print descriptions of
what they draw, and offers the `describeAs` and `endDescription`
functions to provide custom descriptions of collections of turtle
commands. These printed descriptions can be used to verify that drawing
matches a specified desired drawing.

    Draws the given text, centered in a box that's centered on the
    turtle's current position. The box dimensions provided are used to
    scale the font size so that the text fits in the box. An actual box
    is not drawn (but you could call `drawRectangle` to add one).

    The `minSize`, `maxSize`, and `aspectRatio` arguments are passed
    through to `fontSizeForTextInBox`.

    The turtle is returned to its original heading + position when the
    drawing is done, and the font size is changed back to the default.
    If the font is not already Courier New, it will be set to that font
    temporarily.

    Unlike drawText, the text is centered vertically on the turtle's
    position.
