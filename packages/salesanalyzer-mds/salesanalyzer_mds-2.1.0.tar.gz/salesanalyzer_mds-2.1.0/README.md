A python package that helps with the analysis on a sales data. The packagage will contain functions to be used as tools for identifying market segment, predicting future sales and analyzing seasonal revenue trends. <br>

The sales_analyzer package will be an addition to the Python ecosystem as a specialized tool for analyzing retail sales data, targeting small to medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources for an in-house data analytics team and who could benefit from ready-to-use functions for common sales-related tasks. While existing packages such as `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn` provide general tools for data manipulation and machine learning predictions, `salesanalyzer_mds` aims to streamline the process by offering a suite of pre-built, retail-specific analytical functions.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install salesanalyzer_mds
```

## Functions

- `segment_revenue_share`: Segments products into three categories: cheap, medium, expensive, based on price, and calculates their respective share in total revenue. 
- `predictSales`: Predicts future sales based on the provided historical data and the target.
- `sales_summary_statistics`: Calculates a variety of summary statistics that provide insights into overall sales performance,
    customer behavior, and product performance.

## Usage

`salesanalyzer_mds` can be used to extract sales data insights from available data.
1. Set up imports

```
from salesanalyzer_mds.sales_summary_statistics import sales_summary_statistics
from salesanalyzer_mds.segment_revenue_share import segment_revenue_share
from salesanalyzer_mds.predict_sales import predict_sales
import pandas as pd     # additional import to handle your sales data
```

2. Load your sales data as pandas DataFrame

3. Retrieve the insights:

**Summary statistics**

```
sales_summary_statistics(your_sales_data)
```

The `sales_summary_statistics()` function returns a pandas DataFrame with:

- 'total_revenue': The total revenue generated by all sales.
- 'unique_customers': The number of unique customers.
- 'average_order_value': The average value of an order (sum of revenue per invoice).
- 'top_selling_product_quantity': The product with the highest quantity sold.
- 'top_selling_product_revenue': The product with the highest total revenue.
- 'average_revenue_per_customer': The average revenue generated by each customer.

**Segment revenue share**

```
segment_revenue_share(your_sales_data, 
                      price_col='UnitPrice', 
                      quantity_col='Quantity',
                      price_thresholds=None)      # replace column names with your data column names
```

The `segment_revenue_share()` funtion returns a pandas DataFrame showing the total revenue share for each price segment:
'cheap', 'medium', 'expensive'. Custom price thresholds can be set by the user other set automatically.

- Custom price thresholds can be set using the `price_thresholds` parameter.
- If not specified, thresholds are automatically determined based on the data.

**Predict sales**

```
predict_sales(your_sales_data, 
              new_data,     # new sales data to base the predictions on
              numeric_features = ['UnitPrice'],
              categorical_features = ['Description', 'Country'], 
              target = 'Quantity', 
              date_feature = 'InvoiceDate')
```

The `predict_sales()` function returns a DataFrame with prediction values, and a printed out MSE score.
