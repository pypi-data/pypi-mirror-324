A Python package designed to simplify retail sales data analysis for small to medium-sized businesses. This tool offers a set of pre-built functions that make it easy to identify market segments, predict future sales, and analyze seasonal revenue trends.  <br>

## Why sales_analyzer?

Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) often lack the resources for in-house data teams or complex analytics tools. sales_analyzer is here to bridge that gap by providing easy-to-use, specialized functions that allow businesses to extract valuable insights from their sales data without requiring deep expertise in data science.

### Key Benefits:

- **Tailored for SMBs**: No need for expensive or complex tools. Our package is designed specifically for small to medium-sized businesses to help them make data-driven decisions with ease.
- **Easy-to-use functions**: Simple, pre-built functions for common retail sales tasks so you can get started right away.
- **Cost-effective**: Instead of hiring a full-time data analytics team or paying for expensive software, this package offers an affordable, one-stop solution to meet your businessâ€™s analytical needs.
- **Actionable Insights**: Gain a better understanding of your market segments and sales trends, which can inform inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer outreach.

## How It Fits into the Python Ecosystem

While existing Python packages such as `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn` provide powerful general-purpose tools for data manipulation and machine learning, they require significant customization and specialized knowledge to be applied effectively to retail sales analysis. `sales_analyzer` complements these tools by streamlining common retail-specific tasks. It provides a suite of pre-built, easy-to-use functions specifically tailored to sales data, so businesses don't need to spend time customizing solutions for their needs.


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install salesanalyzer_mds
```

## Functions

- `segment_revenue_share`: Segments products into three categories: cheap, medium, expensive, based on price, and calculates their respective share in total revenue. 
- `predictSales`: Predicts future sales based on the provided historical data and the target.
- `sales_summary_statistics`: Calculates a variety of summary statistics that provide insights into overall sales performance,
    customer behavior, and product performance.

## Usage

`salesanalyzer_mds` can be used to extract sales data insights from available data.
1. Set up imports

```python
from salesanalyzer_mds.sales_summary_statistics import sales_summary_statistics
from salesanalyzer_mds.segment_revenue_share import segment_revenue_share
from salesanalyzer_mds.predict_sales import predict_sales
import pandas as pd     # additional import to handle your sales data
```

2. Load your sales data as pandas DataFrame

3. Retrieve the insights:

**Summary statistics**

```python
sales_summary_statistics(your_sales_data)
```

The `sales_summary_statistics()` function returns a pandas DataFrame with:

- 'total_revenue': The total revenue generated by all sales.
- 'unique_customers': The number of unique customers.
- 'average_order_value': The average value of an order (sum of revenue per invoice).
- 'top_selling_product_quantity': The product with the highest quantity sold.
- 'top_selling_product_revenue': The product with the highest total revenue.
- 'average_revenue_per_customer': The average revenue generated by each customer.

**Segment revenue share**

```python
segment_revenue_share(your_sales_data, 
                      price_col='UnitPrice', 
                      quantity_col='Quantity',
                      price_thresholds=None)      # replace column names with your data column names
```

The `segment_revenue_share()` funtion returns a pandas DataFrame showing the total revenue share for each price segment:
'cheap', 'medium', 'expensive'. Custom price thresholds can be set by the user other set automatically.

- Custom price thresholds can be set using the `price_thresholds` parameter.
- If not specified, thresholds are automatically determined based on the data.

**Predict sales**

```python
predict_sales(your_sales_data, 
              new_data,     # new sales data to base the predictions on
              numeric_features = ['UnitPrice'],
              categorical_features = ['Description', 'Country'], 
              target = 'Quantity', 
              date_feature = 'InvoiceDate')
```

The `predict_sales()` function returns a DataFrame with prediction values, and a printed out MSE score.
