# PyScrew

PyScrew is a Python package designed to simplify access to industrial research data from screw driving experiments. It provides a streamlined interface for downloading, validating, and preparing experimental datasets hosted on Zenodo.

More information on the data is available here: https://zenodo.org/records/14769379

## Features

- **Easy Data Access**: Simple interface to download and extract screw driving datasets
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic checksum verification and secure extraction
- **Caching System**: Smart caching to prevent redundant downloads
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Memory Efficient**: Handles large datasets through streaming operations
- **Secure**: Implements protection against common security vulnerabilities

## Installation

Install PyScrew directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyscrew
```

## Quck start

```python 
import pyscrew

# List available datasets
scenarios = pyscrew.list_scenarios()
print("Available datasets:", scenarios)

# Download and extract a specific dataset
data_path = pyscrew.get_data("thread-degradation")
print(f"Data extracted to: {data_path}")
```

## API Reference


### Main Functions
`get_data(scenario_name: str, cache_dir: Optional[Path] = None, force: bool = False) -> Path`

Downloads and extracts a specific dataset.

* `scenario_name`: Name of the dataset to download
* `cache_dir`: Optional custom cache directory (default: ~/.cache/pyscrew)
* `force`: Force re-download even if cached
* **Returns:** Path to extracted dataset

`list_scenarios() -> Dict[str, str]`

Lists all available datasets and their descriptions.

* Returns: Dictionary mapping scenario names to descriptions

## Cache Structure

Downloaded data is stored in:

```bash 
~/.cache/pyscrew/
├── archives/     # Compressed dataset archives
└── extracted/    # Extracted dataset files
```

## Development
The package is under active development. Further implementation will add data processing utilities and data validation tools.
