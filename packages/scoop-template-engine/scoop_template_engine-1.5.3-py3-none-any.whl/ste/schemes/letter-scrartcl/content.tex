\opening{Dear Lisa,}

I hope this letter finds you well.
Have you had a chance to look at the draft of our manuscript \emph{Carrying the One Effectively} that I sent you last week?
% I can't wait to hear your thoughts on it.


\subsection*{On a Different Note}

Have you read \cite{DetlefsenErlandsonHestonYoung:1976:1} yet?
I highly recommend it to you.
We can discuss it when we meet next time.
