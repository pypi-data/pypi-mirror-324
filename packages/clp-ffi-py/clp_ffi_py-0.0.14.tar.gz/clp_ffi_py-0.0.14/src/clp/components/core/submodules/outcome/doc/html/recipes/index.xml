      <title>ASIO/Networking TS : Boost &lt; 1.70</title>

      <description>Thanks to Christos Stratopoulos for this Outcome recipe.
Compatibility note This recipe targets Boost versions before 1.70, where coroutine support is based around the asio::experimental::this_coro::token completion token. For integration with Boost versions 1.70 and onward, see this recipe.
Use case Boost.ASIO and standalone ASIO provide the async_result customisation point for adapting arbitrary third party libraries, such as Outcome, into ASIO.
Historically in ASIO you need to pass completion handler instances to the ASIO asynchronous i/o initiation functions.</description>

      <title>Extending `OUTCOME_TRY`</title>
      <link>https://ned14.github.io/outcome/recipes/foreign-try/</link>

      <description>Outcome&amp;rsquo;s OUTCOME_TRY(var, expr) operation is fully extensible to accept as input any foreign types. It already recognises types matching the concepts::value_or_error&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt; concept, which is to say all types which have:
 A public .has_value() member function which returns a bool. In order of preference, a public .assume_value()/.value() member function. In order of preference, a public .as_failure()/.assume_error()/.error() member function.  This should automatically handle inputs of std::expected&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt;, and many others, including intermixing Boost.</description>
