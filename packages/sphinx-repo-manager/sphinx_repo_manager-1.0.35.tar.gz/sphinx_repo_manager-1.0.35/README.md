## About

This Sphinx extension by [Xsolla Backend [XBE]](https://docs.goxbe.io) automates the management of multiple
documentation repositories as part of building a larger, unified documentation system. It facilitates multithreaded
cloning and updating of external repositories specified in a YAML manifest file before Sphinx builds.

📜 See the XBE [docgen source code](https://source.goxbe.io/Core/docs/xbe_static_docs)
and [demo](https://docs.goxbe.io) doc production site heavily making use of this extension.
Here, you may also find tips for how to utilize this extension to its greatest capabilities.

## Installation

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
[RST](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html)

### Add to Existing Project

1. Install the extension [via pip](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-repo-manager):

   ```bash
    pip install sphinx-repo-manager
   ```

2. Add extension to your project's
   [docs/source/conf.py](https://github.com/Unidocs1/sphinx_repo_manager/blob/master/docs/source/conf.py)
   (example template):

   ```python
   extensions = [ "sphinx_repo_manager" ] ,  # https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-repo-manager
   ```

3. Ensure a `docs/.env` file exists next to your `Makefile` -> set `REPO_AUTH_TOKEN=`

4. Create a 
   [docs/repo_manifest.yml](https://github.com/Unidocs1/sphinx_repo_manager/blob/master/docs/repo_manifest.yml)
   (example template) next to your `Makefile`

   * 💡 Optionally, set the manifest `max_workers_local` to a higher number for faster local builds 
     [even `30` is ok for high-end machines!]

Once setup, sphinx-build as normal (typically via `make html` next to your `Makefile`)!

### Tips

- **Windows user?** You may want to *unlock your max char paths* by running `tools/admin-enable-long-file-paths.ps1` 
  *as admin*
- Editing the manifest?
   - Consider purging your `docs/source/_repos-available` and `docs/source/content` dirs
- Want speedier build iterations?
   - Test bumping up your `max_workers_local` counts - even *significantly* higher - for high-end machines!

## Demos

### Minimal Demo

1. Clone the [source repo](https://github.com/Unidocs1/sphinx_repo_manager) for a demo:

- Minimal build architecture begins at at `docs/`
- `repo_manifest.yml` contains a minimal [sphinx_demo_doc](https://github.com/Unidocs1/sphinx_demo_doc) repo to be cloned

### Production Demo

Alternately, see `sphinx_repo_manager` used by Xsolla Backend at a production-grade level:

- [Source Code](https://source.goxbe.io/Core/docs/xbe_static_docs)
- [Production Site](https://docs.goxbe.io)

## How it Works

1. `repo_manifest.yml` lists repositories with their respective clone URLs [and optional rules].
2. `docs/source/` creates `_repos-available` (src repos) and `content` (symlinked) dirs.
3. Upon running `sphinx-build` (commonly via `make html`), the extension either clones or updates each repo defined
   within the manifest.
4. Source clones will [sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) and symlink to the `content`
   dir, allowing for flexibility such as custom entry points and custom names (such as for shorter url slugs).
5. All repos in the manifest will be organized in a monolithic doc.

💡 If you want to store *local* content (eg, static `.rst`), add it to `source/_source-docs/`

💡 The only RST file expected for your monolithic repo is the `index.rst` file (next to your `conf.py`)

⌛ 5 local workers (default) will take only ~50s to process 30 repos with default manifest settings
