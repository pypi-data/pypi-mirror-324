# Installing

Download [locas_installer.py](https://github.com/Linos1391/LocalAssistant/releases/download/v1.1.1/locas_installer.py), and let magic happens.
```
python3 locas_installer.py
```

Let's try if it works:
```
locas.cmd -h
```

<br>

# Preparing

To chat, we will need model! You can download other models you want. Below is my recommend for first use (Like a starter pack.)

**For text generation:**
*(Choose other models from [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&library=safetensors&sort=trending).)*
```
locas.cmd download -n qwen Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct 1
```

**For sentence transformer:**
*(Choose other models from [here](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers?sort_models=modified#models).)*
```
locas.cmd download -n minilm sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 2
```

**For cross encoder:**
*(Choose other models from [here](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder?sort_models=modified#models).)*
```
locas.cmd download -n msmarco cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 3
```

# Running

By default, `locas` works at most of the time:

*(Unix user may try `locas.cmd ...` first. Window user can use both `locas` and `locas.cmd`)*
```
locas ...
```

Learn more about useful functions:
```
locas -h
```

To deactivate: *(It uses python's virtual environment)*
