# Brief Overview

LocalAssistant is an AI that communicating through terminal. Even though currently in development, it is equipped with communication function, memory ability and document query. I made this for an even bigger project later, so until fully completed, it will not be dropped.

# Contribution

Below is what I tried but could not get it done. So your help will help me a lot!

- **Call time:** I tested `locas` with Powershell's `Measure-Command`, I got 7-9s. But then when trying with `CProfile.run()`, it's approximately 0.2s... Why...?
- **pytest:** I know this sounds wrong, but I don't even know where to start. Maybe I will try again, but not right now I guess.

Not just those above. All contributions are welcomed, I would be grateful for one day having peer coders beside me!
