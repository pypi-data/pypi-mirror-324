We are very keen to get feedback on ``spikewrap``. Does this interface for running electrophysiology analysis will work for you?

Please get in contact with feedback and suggestions, either by joining our 
[Zulip Chat](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406002-Spikewrap)
or opening a
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/spikewrap/issues)

After a round of feedback, we plan to extend the ``spikewrap``'s featuresâ€”
see our [Roadmap](roadmap) for details.
