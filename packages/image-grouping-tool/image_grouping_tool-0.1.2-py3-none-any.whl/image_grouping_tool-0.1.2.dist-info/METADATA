# Image Grouping Tool

The current package contains tools for analysing big sets of images by leveraging CNN models as images descriptors. Currently the package contains a cli tool with the following commands:

```bash
image_grouping compute_features <path_to_image_folders>
```

The command above scans the appointed folder for PNG and JPEG images and generates a .pt file containing the features and image paths.

```bash
image_grouping apply_pca <path_to_features_file>
```

Applies the PCA algorithm for dimension reduction and stores it to a second file.

```bash
image_grouping cluster <path_to_features_file>
```

Clusterizes data and plots results.

for a more detailed list of params it is possible to use the *--help* command with each of these options.
