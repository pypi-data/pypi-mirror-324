# Common Issues and Solutions

Q: Python version not found (e.g., "pyenv: version '3.13' is not installed")
A: Update requires-python in pyproject.toml to use an installed version (e.g., ">=3.8")

Q: Package has no executables ("The executable was not found")
A: Add [project.scripts] section in pyproject.toml:
   [project.scripts]
   your-cmd = "your_package.main:main"

Q: Multiple top-level packages error
A: Use minimal build configuration with hatchling:
   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"

Q: File already exists on PyPI
A: 1. Update version in pyproject.toml
   2. Clean old builds: rm -rf dist/*
   3. Rebuild and publish

Q: Package not found after publishing
A: Wait a few minutes for PyPI to update, or install directly from wheel:
   uv pip install dist/package-version-py3-none-any.whl
