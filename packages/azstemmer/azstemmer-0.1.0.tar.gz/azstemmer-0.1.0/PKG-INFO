# AzStemmer 📚
**AzStemmer** is a basic stemming library for Azerbaijani sentences. It is not highly effective but offers a simple way to stem Azerbaijani words, especially for cases where you need to reduce words to their root form. The stemmer uses a dictionary of root words and performs stemming based on that list.

## Installation ⬇️
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install azstemmer.

```bash
pip install azstemmer
```

## Usage ⚙️

```python
from azstemmer import AzStemmer

# Initialize stemmer with the appropriate keyboard type
# Use 'az' for Azerbaijani text or 'en' if the text is typed using an English keyboard
stemmer = AzStemmer(keyboard="az") 

# Stem your string
stemmed_string = stemmer.stem("your_string")
```

## Features 🧩
- Azerbaijani Stemming: Reduces Azerbaijani words to their root forms.
- English Keyboard Support: You can choose 'az' or 'en' for proper stemming based on the keyboard used for typing.
- Simple and Lightweight: A straightforward way to perform stemming without any advanced NLP models.

## Known Issues or Limitations ❗
- As the stemming is based on a dictionary of words, special names (e.g., proper nouns) cannot be stemmed.
- Some words may not be stemmed correctly due to the limitations of the dictionary-based approach.
