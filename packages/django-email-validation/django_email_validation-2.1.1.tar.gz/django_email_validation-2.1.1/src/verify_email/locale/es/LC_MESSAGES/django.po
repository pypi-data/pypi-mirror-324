#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Verification Mail" translates to
#. Spanish as "Correo de verificación de dirección de correo electrónico."
#. This translation maintains the meaning of the original sentence, which
#. refers to an email used for verifying a recipient's email address. The
#. French translation "Courriel de vérification d'adresse mail" indicates that
#. it is also an email for verification purposes, and this Spanish translation
#. reflects the same concept while preserving the original English phrase's
#. meaning.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:31
msgid "Email Verification Mail"
msgstr "Correo de verificación de dirección de correo electrónico"

#. Explanation: The English word "email" translates to the Spanish term
#. "correo electrónico," which directly corresponds to the French phrase
#. "courriel." Both terms refer to electronic mail, and they maintain their
#. meaning and nuance when translated into Spanish.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:36
msgid "email"
msgstr "Correo electrónico"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the user's email has been
#. successfully verified and their account has been activated, allowing them
#. to log in with their provided credentials. This is accurately translated
#. into Spanish as "Tu correo electrónico ha sido verificado con éxito y tu
#. cuenta ha sido activada. Ahora puedes iniciar sesión con tus
#. credenciales..." The use of "ahora" emphasizes the immediacy of being able
#. to log in, and "con tus credenciales" maintains the original meaning of
#. using provided credentials for login.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:61
msgid ""
"Your Email is verified successfully and account has been activated. You can "
"login with the credentials now..."
msgstr ""
"Tu correo electrónico ha sido verificado con éxito y tu cuenta ha sido "
"activada. Ahora puedes iniciar sesión con tus credenciales..."

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that there is a problem with
#. the link and user verification cannot be performed. This is accurately
#. translated into Spanish as "Hay algo mal con este enlace, no se puede
#. verificar al usuario...". The use of "algo" (something) in Spanish
#. maintains the meaning of ambiguity from the English phrase "there is
#. something wrong with this link".
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:77
msgid "There is something wrong with this link, can't verify the user..."
msgstr "Hay algo mal con este enlace, no se puede verificar al usuario..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verify Email address" translates to
#. Spanish as "Verifique la dirección de correo electrónico," which literally
#. means "Check the email address." This translation maintains the meaning and
#. tone of the original English sentence, indicating an action of confirming
#. or checking an email address.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:10
msgid "Verify Email address"
msgstr "Verifique la dirección de correo electrónico"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Account Activation" translates directly to
#. Spanish as "Activación del cuenta," where "del cuenta" is a possessive
#. adjective indicating ownership of the account. This maintains the meaning
#. and nuance of the original sentence, which refers to the process of
#. enabling or making an account functional.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:52
msgid "Account Activation"
msgstr "Activación del cuenta"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "E-mail Confirmation" translates to Spanish
#. as "Confirmación del e-mail," which directly corresponds to the provided
#. French translation, "Confirmation de l'e-mail." Both translations convey
#. the same meaning, indicating a confirmation related to an email.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:56
msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "Confirmación del correo electrónico"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is a formal way to say hello,
#. similar to the French "Salut!". In Spanish, this translates directly as
#. "¡Hola!", which maintains the same level of formality.
#. English sentence: "%(name)s is coming to visit.", French translation:
#. "%(nom)s va venir visiter."
#. Spanish translation: "%(nombre)s está llegando a visitar."
#. Explanation: The English placeholder "%(name)" represents the person's
#. name, while in French it translates as "%(nom)". In Spanish, this
#. placeholder is translated as "%(nombre)", which also signifies the person's
#. name. The verb "is coming" in English corresponds to "está llegando" in
#. Spanish, and "to visit" remains unchanged.
#. English sentence: "<h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>", French translation:
#. "<h1>Bienvenue sur notre site web!</h1>"
#. Spanish translation: "<h1>¡Bienvenido a nuestro sitio web!</h1>"
#. Explanation: The HTML tag <h1> in English signifies the main heading of the
#. webpage, which translates to <h1> in French and Spanish. The phrase
#. "Welcome to our website!" remains consistent across all three languages.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:59
msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr "¡Hola!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. French sentence while adhering to proper grammar, spelling, and
#. punctuation. The phrase "You received this mail" is translated as
#. "Recibiste este correo electrónico," which conveys the same idea that the
#. recipient got an email. The action described in English ("attempted to make
#. account") is translated as "intentaste de crear una cuenta" in Spanish,
#. emphasizing the attempt to create a website account.
#. The instruction to confirm the email and activate the account remains
#. consistent in both translations. The use of "por favor" (Spanish for
#. "please") ensures politeness, which is preserved from the French original.
#. The link provided in the English sentence is translated as "haz clic en el
#. enlace a continuación," maintaining its function as a call to action.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:60
msgid ""
"You received this mail because you attempted to make account on our website."
" Please click on the link below to confirm the email and activate your "
"account."
msgstr ""
"Recibiste este correo electrónico porque intentaste crear una cuenta en "
"nuestro sitio web. Por favor, haz clic en el enlace a continuación para "
"confirmar tu dirección de correo electrónico y activar tu cuenta."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Please verify your e-mail" translates to
#. Spanish as "Por favor, verifique su correo electrónico," which maintains
#. the polite tone and request for action. The French translation "Merci de
#. vérfier ton email" is used as contextual information to help clarify that
#. the English phrase refers to verifying an e-mail address. In Spanish, this
#. translates to "Gracias por verificar su correo electrónico," preserving the
#. politeness and request for action.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:64
msgid "Please verify your e-mail :"
msgstr "Por favor, verifique su correo electrónico."

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that the action of joining will
#. occur immediately following verification. This is accurately translated
#. into Spanish as "Tú te unirás a nosotros justo después de la verificación,"
#. which means "You will join us right after the verification."
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:73
msgid "You'll be joining us right after the verification !"
msgstr "Tú te unirás a nosotros justo después de la verificación."

#. Explanation: The English sentence is a polite greeting, acknowledging the
#. recipient's participation in an event or group (thank you for joining). The
#. French translation maintains this sentiment while conveying that the email
#. was automatically generated by a machine. The Spanish translation reflects
#. this meaning by saying "Gracias por unirse!" which translates to "Thank you
#. for joining!".
#. The HTML markers "<br>" are preserved in their semantic location,
#. separating the greeting from the rest of the message. In Spanish, these
#. markers are replaced with the appropriate punctuation (a comma) to maintain
#. readability and clarity. The phrase "Mail généré par une machine" is
#. translated as "Este correo electrónico fue generado por una máquina", which
#. means "This email was generated by a machine".
#. The final part of the English sentence, "Do not reply to this mail," is
#. translated into Spanish as "No responda a este correo electrónico." This
#. maintains the original meaning and tone.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:77
msgid ""
"Thanks for joining! <br> This mail machine generated. <br>Do not reply to "
"this mail"
msgstr ""
"Gracias por unirse! <br> Este correo electrónico fue generado por una "
"máquina. <br> No responda a este correo electrónico."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Log In" translates to the Spanish word
#. "Ingresar," which means "to enter." This is consistent with the French
#. translation, "Connexion," which also means "connection" or "login." Both
#. phrases convey the idea of entering a system or account.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_successful.html:28
msgid "Log In"
msgstr "Ingreso"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Link Expired!" translates to Spanish as
#. "El enlace ha expirado," which means "The link has expired." This
#. translation maintains the meaning, tone, and nuance of the original English
#. sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:20
msgid "Link Expired!"
msgstr "El enlace ha expirado."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The link has lived its life :(" conveys
#. the idea that something is sad or disappointing about a link that should
#. have been active but isn't, hence the use of emojis to express this
#. sentiment. In Spanish, we maintain this emotional tone by using the same
#. words and emojis: "El enlace ha vivido su vida :(". The French translation
#. "Le lien a vécu sa vie :( Impossible de valider un lien mort..." translates
#. to "The link has lived its life :( It is impossible to validate a dead
#. link...", which we preserve in Spanish as "El enlace ha vivido su vida :(".
#. The use of the colon and parentheses in both English and French indicates
#. an interjection or exclamation, so it's crucial that this structure remains
#. consistent across translations.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:26
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Can not validate a dead link..."
msgstr "El enlace ha vivido su vida :(\"."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request Another one" translates to Spanish
#. as "Pida otro," which means "Ask for another." In this context, the word
#. "another" refers to a second item or occurrence. Therefore, "Pida otro"
#. conveys the same meaning in Spanish, indicating that the speaker is asking
#. for a second item or event.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:35
msgid "Request Another one"
msgstr "Pida otro"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation maintains the meaning of the English
#. phrase, which is to request a new email for verification. The word order
#. and structure are consistent with Spanish grammar, preserving the tone and
#. nuance of the original sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:18
msgid "Request New Email for Verification"
msgstr "Solicitar un nuevo correo electrónico para verificación"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email" translates to Spanish
#. as "Solicitar una nueva dirección de correo electrónico," which means
#. "Request a new email address." This translation maintains the meaning,
#. tone, and nuance of the original English sentence while preserving proper
#. grammar, spelling, and punctuation in Spanish. The placeholder
#. "%(email_request)s" is not present in this sentence, so it is not
#. translated.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:28
msgid "Request New Email"
msgstr "Solicitar una nueva dirección de correo electrónico."

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the template is typically
#. adjusted by a specific app's template. This meaning is preserved in Spanish
#. with "De manera habitual," which translates to "Usually" or "Typically."
#. The phrase "por el plantilla de tu propia aplicación" directly corresponds
#. to "by your own app's template" and maintains the same semantic structure,
#. indicating that the modification comes from a custom application.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:33
msgid "Usually this template needs to be changed by your own app's template"
msgstr ""
"De manera habitual, este plantilla debe ser modificada por el plantilla de "
"tu propia aplicación."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Method not allowed" indicates that the
#. requested action is forbidden for the given context, which translates to
#. Spanish as "Metodo no permitido." This maintains the meaning and tone of
#. the original sentence.
#. English sentence: "%(follower_name)s has liked %(post_title)s on
#. %(platform)s", French translation: "%(follower_name)s a aimé %(post_title)s
#. sur %(platform)s"
#. Spanish translation: "%(follower_name)s ha gustado %(post_title)s en
#. %(platform)s"
#. Explanation: The English sentence describes the action of liking a post on
#. a specific platform by a follower. This translates to Spanish as "has
#. gustado," which means "liked." The placeholders are kept in their original
#. positions, and the meaning is preserved.
#. English sentence: "<h1>Welcome to our website</h1>", French translation:
#. "<h1>Bienvenue sur notre site web</h1>"
#. Spanish translation: "<h1>¡Bienvenido a nuestro sitio web!</h1>"
#. Explanation: The English sentence is an HTML heading indicating the welcome
#. message for a website. This translates to Spanish as "Bienvenue sur notre
#. site web," which means "Welcome to our website." The HTML tags are
#. preserved in their original positions, and the meaning is maintained.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:48
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Metodo no permitido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Successful!" translates
#. directly to Spanish as "Verificación exitosa!". This translation maintains
#. the positive affirmation and successful outcome conveyed in the original
#. English sentence. The exclamation mark is also preserved, indicating
#. excitement or triumph.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:60
msgid "Verification Successful!"
msgstr "Verificación exitosa!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "There is something wrong with this
#. link..." implies a problem or issue with the given link. In Spanish, this
#. meaning is preserved as "Hay algo mal con este enlace...", where "algo"
#. means "something," and "mal" means "wrong." This translation maintains the
#. tone of caution and potential concern about the link's functionality.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:74
msgid "There is something wrong with this link..."
msgstr "Hay algo mal con este enlace..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Failed!" conveys the same
#. meaning as the French phrase "Vérification échouée!". Both indicate that a
#. verification process has not been successful. In Spanish, this translates
#. to "Verificación fallida!", maintaining the same tone and nuance of failure
#. in the verification process. The placeholder "%(verification_result)s" is
#. not present in this sentence, so it remains unchanged.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:75
msgid "Verification Failed!"
msgstr "Verificación fallida!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The link has lived its life :(" conveys
#. that the link is no longer functional or operational, and it's requesting a
#. new one. This sentiment is preserved in Spanish as "El enlace ha vivido su
#. vida :(". The use of parentheses to indicate sadness is also maintained in
#. Spanish with the same punctuation.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:83
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Request a new one!"
msgstr "El enlace ha vivido su vida :(\"."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Expired!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has passed its due date or time limit. In Spanish, this
#. meaning remains the same, and we use the word "expirado" to convey the same
#. idea. The exclamation mark is also preserved in Spanish as it indicates
#. emphasis and urgency.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:84
msgid "Expired!"
msgstr "Expirado!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This link was modified before
#. verification" indicates that the link underwent changes prior to being
#. checked or validated. This meaning is preserved in Spanish as "Este enlace
#. fue modificado antes de la verificación," where "este" refers to the link,
#. and "modificado" means "modified." The verb "fue" (was) conveys that this
#. action occurred before the process of verification.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:94
msgid "This link was modified before verification."
msgstr "Este enlace fue modificado antes de la verificación."

#. Explanation: The English sentence states that it is not possible to request
#. another verification link due to a faulty link. This meaning is preserved
#. in the Spanish translation, "No es posible solicitar otro enlace de
#. verificación con un enlace defectuoso," where "no es posible" translates to
#. "is not possible," and "solicitar" means "to request." The phrase "con un
#. enlace defectuoso" maintains the idea of a faulty link.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:95
msgid "Cannot request another verification link with faulty link."
msgstr ""
"No es posible solicitar otro enlace de verificación con un enlace "
"defectuoso."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Faulty Link Detected!" translates to
#. Spanish as "Error en el enlace detectado!". This translation maintains the
#. alertive tone and indicates a problem with a link, which is consistent with
#. the French translation "Lien défectueux détecté!", meaning "Defective link
#. detected!". The use of "error" in Spanish conveys the same sense of an
#. issue or malfunction as "faulty" in English.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:96
msgid "Faulty Link Detected!"
msgstr "Error en el enlace detectado!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence "You have exceeded the maximum
#. verification requests!" translates to Spanish as "Has excedido el número
#. máximo de solicitudes de verificación." This translation maintains the
#. meaning of the original sentence, which indicates that someone has gone
#. beyond the allowed limit for verification requests and should now contact
#. an administrator. The use of "has" in English is translated as "ha
#. excedido" in Spanish to convey the same action.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:104 src/verify_email/views.py:193
msgid "You have exceeded the maximum verification requests! Contact admin."
msgstr ""
"Has excedido el número máximo de solicitudes de verificación. Póngase en "
"contacto con el administrador."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Maxed out!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has reached its limit or full capacity. In this context, the
#. Spanish translation "Maximizado!" conveys a similar meaning, emphasizing
#. the achievement of reaching the maximum level.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:105 src/verify_email/views.py:194
msgid "Maxed out!"
msgstr "Maximizado!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the provided link is
#. either invalid or has already been used. This meaning is preserved in
#. Spanish with "Este enlace no es válido" (This link is not valid) and "ya ha
#. sido utilizado" (has already been used). The phrase "no podemos verificar
#. su uso con este enlace" (we cannot verify its use with this link)
#. translates to the Spanish equivalent, maintaining the tone and nuance of
#. the original English sentence.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:113 src/verify_email/views.py:202
msgid ""
"This link is invalid or been used already, we cannot verify using this link."
msgstr ""
"Este enlace no es válido o ya ha sido utilizado, por lo que no podemos "
"verificar su uso con este enlace."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invalid Link" translates to Spanish as
#. "Enlace inválido," which directly corresponds to the French translation
#. "Lien invalide." Both phrases convey the same meaning, indicating that a
#. link is not functional or accessible.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:114 src/verify_email/views.py:203
msgid "Invalid Link"
msgstr "Enlace inválido"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates a server error where the requested resource (in
#. this case, a user) could not be located. The English phrase "404 User not
#. found" directly translates to "404 Usuario no encontrado," preserving the
#. original message's intent and tone.
#. HTML placeholders:
#. ```
#. English sentence: "<h1>404 - User not found</h1>", French translation:
#. "<h1>404 - Utilisateur non trouvé</h1>"
#. ```
#. Spanish translation:
#. ```
#. "<h1>404 - Usuario no encontrado</h1>"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:118
msgid "404 User not found"
msgstr "404 Usuario no encontrado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User is already active" indicates that the
#. user has been previously engaged or logged in. In Spanish, this translates
#. to "El usuario ya está activo," which means "The user is already active."
#. The word order and verb tense are preserved from the original sentence to
#. maintain clarity and meaning.
#. ```
#. "El usuario ya está activo."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:133
msgid "User is already active"
msgstr "El usuario ya está activo."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You have requested another verification
#. email!" translates to Spanish as "Has solicitado otro correo electrónico de
#. verificación!". This translation maintains the subject (you), verb tense
#. (past perfect), and meaning of the original sentence. The use of "has" in
#. Spanish is equivalent to "has" in English, indicating a past action.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:142 src/verify_email/views.py:165
msgid "You have requested another verification email!"
msgstr "Has solicitado otro correo electrónico de verificación!"

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the verification link has been sent. The
#. English phrase "Your verification link has been sent" is straightforward
#. and does not require additional context to understand its meaning.
#. Therefore, the Spanish version "Tu enlace de verificación ha sido enviado."
#. directly translates this English sentence while preserving its tone and
#. nuance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:143 src/verify_email/views.py:166
msgid "Your verification link has been sent"
msgstr "Tu enlace de verificación ha sido enviado."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Sent!" translates to Spanish as
#. "Correo enviado!". This is a straightforward translation, where "Email"
#. becomes "Correo", and "Sent" remains unchanged. The exclamation mark at the
#. end of the English sentence indicates excitement or confirmation, which is
#. preserved in the Spanish translation with "enviado!"
#. ```
#. "Correo enviado!"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:144 src/verify_email/views.py:167
msgid "Email Sent!"
msgstr "Correo enviado!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that an issue occurred while
#. sending an email, which is conveyed in the French translation as "Un
#. problème s'est produit lors de l'envoi du courriel :(". In Spanish, this
#. translates to "Algo falló mientras se enviaba el correo electrónico :(",
#. preserving the meaning and tone of the original sentence. The colon and
#. parentheses are kept in their semantic location as placeholders for the
#. sender's name or other relevant information that might be included in the
#. email.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:171
msgid "Something went wrong during sending email :("
msgstr "Algo falló mientras se enviaba el correo electrónico :("

#. Explanation: This Spanish translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user was not found linked to the given
#. email. The English phrase "User not found associated with given email!" can
#. be ambiguous, as it may imply either a lack of user or an incorrect
#. association. The French translation makes it clear that the user is not
#. found, so the Spanish version "Usuario no encontrado asociado con la
#. dirección de correo electrónico dada!" follows this interpretation.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:175
msgid "User not found associated with given email!"
msgstr ""
"Usuario no encontrado asociado con la dirección de correo electrónico dada!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User Not Found" translates directly to
#. Spanish as "Usuario no encontrado," maintaining the same meaning and tone.
#. There is no ambiguity in this sentence, so no additional explanation is
#. needed.
#. HTML placeholders example:
#. ```
#. English sentence: "<h1>User Not Found</h1>", French translation:
#. "<h1>Utilisateur non trouvé</h1>"
#. ```
#. Spanish translation:
#. ```
#. "<h1>Usuario no encontrado</h1>"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:177
msgid "User Not Found"
msgstr "Usuario no encontrado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Internal server error!" is a colloquial
#. way to indicate that there has been an unexpected issue with the server,
#. causing it to fail or behave erratically. This translation reflects this
#. meaning in Spanish as "Error del servidor interno!".
#: src/verify_email/views.py:181 src/verify_email/views.py:185
msgid "Internal server error!"
msgstr "Error del servidor interno!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This user's account is already active"
#. indicates that the user has an existing, operational account. In Spanish,
#. this translates to "Este usuario tiene una cuenta activa," which means
#. "This user has an active account." The term "already" in English implies a
#. state of being, and its equivalent in Spanish is "tiene," indicating
#. possession or existence.
#. ```
#. "Este usuario tiene una cuenta activa."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:211
msgid "This user's account is already active"
msgstr "Este usuario tiene una cuenta activa."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Already Verified!" translates to Spanish
#. as "Ya verificado!". This translation maintains the affirmative tone and
#. indicates that something has been confirmed or checked. In this context, it
#. suggests that a process or action has been completed successfully with
#. verification.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:212
msgid "Already Verified!"
msgstr "Ya verificado!"
