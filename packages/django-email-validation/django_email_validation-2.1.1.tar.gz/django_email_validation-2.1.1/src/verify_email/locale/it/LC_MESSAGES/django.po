#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Verification Mail" translates to
#. Italian as "Mail di verifica dell'indirizzo email". This translation
#. maintains the meaning of the original sentence, which refers to a
#. confirmation email sent for verifying an email address.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:31
msgid "Email Verification Mail"
msgstr "Mail di verifica dell'indirizzo email"

#. Explanation: The English word "email" directly translates to the Italian
#. term "email". There is no need for further explanation as this is a direct
#. and straightforward translation.
#. ```
#. "email"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:36
msgid "email"
msgstr "email"

#. Explanation: This Italian translation maintains the meaning, tone, and
#. nuance of the original English sentence while preserving proper grammar,
#. spelling, and punctuation. The phrase "Your Email is verified successfully"
#. translates to "Il tuo indirizzo email è stato verificato con successo,"
#. which means "Your email has been verified successfully." Similarly, "You
#. can login with the credentials now..." translates to "Puoi ora accedere con
#. i tuoi dati di accesso...", meaning "You can log in now with your
#. credentials." The Italian translation ensures that placeholders and HTML
#. markers are kept in their original semantic locations.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:61
msgid ""
"Your Email is verified successfully and account has been activated. You can "
"login with the credentials now..."
msgstr ""
"Il tuo indirizzo email è stato verificato con successo e il tuo account è "
"stato attivato. Puoi ora accedere con i tuoi dati di accesso..."

#. Explanation: The Italian translation maintains the meaning of the French
#. sentence, which indicates that there is an issue with a specific link and
#. user verification cannot be performed. The phrase "quelque chose ne va pas"
#. translates to "qualcosa che non va," preserving the negative connotation.
#. Similarly, "impossibile" in French becomes "impossibile" in Italian,
#. emphasizing the unfeasibility of user verification.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:77
msgid "There is something wrong with this link, can't verify the user..."
msgstr ""
"C'è qualcosa che non va con questo link, la verifica dell'utente "
"impossibile..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verify Email address" translates directly
#. to Italian as "Verifica indirizzo email," which maintains the same meaning
#. and structure. In this context, "email" is a noun referring to an
#. electronic mail message, and "verify" means to confirm or check the
#. validity of something.
#. ```
#. "Verifica indirizzo email"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:10
msgid "Verify Email address"
msgstr "Verifica indirizzo email"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Account Activation" translates to Italian
#. as "Attivazione dell'account," where "Account" is the direct translation of

#. the same meaning as the French "Activation du compte."
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:52
msgid "Account Activation"
msgstr "Attivazione dell'account"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "E-mail Confirmation" translates to Italian
#. as "Conferma dell'email," which directly conveys the meaning of confirming
#. an email. In this context, the placeholder "%s" in the original French
#. translation does not need to be translated because it is a placeholder for
#. the word "e-mail." Therefore, the Italian translation maintains the same
#. semantic location and does not include any additional words or phrases.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:56
msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "Conferma dell'email"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is an informal way to say
#. hello, similar to the Italian "Ciao!". Both phrases are used in casual
#. contexts and convey a friendly greeting.
#. English sentence: "%(name)s is coming to visit.", French translation:
#. "%(nom)s va venir nous rendre visite."
#. Italian translation: "%(nome)s è venuto a trovarci."
#. Explanation: The English placeholder "%(name)" represents the person's
#. name, while in Italian, it becomes "%(nome)", which also signifies the
#. person's name. Both phrases convey that someone is coming to visit.
#. English sentence: "<h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>", French translation:
#. "<h1>Bienvenue sur notre site web!</h1>"
#. Italian translation: "<h1>Benvenuto nel nostro sito web!</h1>"
#. Explanation: The HTML tag <h1> is used for the main heading of a webpage.
#. In this case, it conveys a welcoming message in both English and French,
#. which translates to "Welcome to our website!" in Italian.
#. English sentence: "%(city)s is known for its beautiful parks.", French
#. translation: "%(ville) est connue pour ses jardins magnifiques."
#. Italian translation: "%(città) è nota per i suoi bellissimi parchi."
#. Explanation: The English placeholder "%(city)" represents the city's name,
#. which in Italian becomes "%(città)", signifying the same location. Both
#. phrases highlight that a particular city is famous for its beautiful parks.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:59
msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr "Ciao!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence informs the recipient that they received
#. a mail due to their attempt to create an account on the website. The
#. Italian translation maintains this meaning by stating that the recipient
#. received the message because they tried to set up an account on the site.
#. The phrase "per confermare l'indirizzo email e attivare il tuo account"
#. translates to "to confirm the email and activate your account," preserving
#. the intent of the original sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:60
msgid ""
"You received this mail because you attempted to make account on our website."
" Please click on the link below to confirm the email and activate your "
"account."

"nostro sito web. Per confermare l'indirizzo email e attivare il tuo account,"
" clicca sul link qui sotto."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Please verify your e-mail" translates to
#. Italian as "Per favore verifica la tua email," which maintains the polite
#. tone and request for action. The French translation "Merci de vérfier ton
#. email" is used as context, indicating that the request is similar in nature
#. to a French request.
#. HTML markers: "<p>Please verify your e-mail:</p>"
#. Italian translation with placeholders: "%s verifica la sua email:"
#. ```
#. <p>%s verifica la sua email:</p>
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:64
msgid "Please verify your e-mail :"
msgstr "Per favore verifica la tua email."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You'll be joining us right after the
#. verification!" conveys that the action of joining will occur immediately
#. following a verification process. In Italian, this is accurately translated
#. as "Ti unirai appena dopo la verifica," which means "You will join us just
#. after the verification." The use of "appena" (just) and "dopo" (after) in
#. Italian maintains the same sense of immediacy as in the English sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:73
msgid "You'll be joining us right after the verification !"
msgstr "Ti unirai appena dopo la verifica."

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys gratitude for joining and informs
#. that the message was generated by a machine, while also advising not to
#. respond. This is accurately translated into Italian as "Grazie per aver
#. partecipato! <br> Questo messaggio è stato generato da una macchina. <br>
#. Non rispondi a questo messaggio." The use of placeholders and HTML markers
#. is preserved in the translation, with "<br>" maintaining its function as a
#. line breaker.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:77
msgid ""
"Thanks for joining! <br> This mail machine generated. <br>Do not reply to "
"this mail"
msgstr ""
"Grazie per aver partecipato! <br> Questo messaggio è stato generato da una "
"macchina. <br> Non rispondi a questo messaggio."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Log In" translates to Italian as "Accedi,"
#. which means the same - to log in or sign in. Both phrases indicate the
#. action of entering a system using credentials, and they are interchangeable
#. in this context.
#. ```
#. "Accedi"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_successful.html:28
msgid "Log In"
msgstr "Accedi"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Link Expired!" translates to Italian as
#. "Link scaduto!". This is a direct translation of the French phrase "Lien
#. expiré!", which means "Link expired!". Both phrases convey the same
#. meaning, indicating that a link has reached its expiration date.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:20
msgid "Link Expired!"
msgstr "Link scaduto!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The link has lived its life :( Can not
#. validate a dead link..." translates to Italian as "Il collegamento ha
#. vissuto la sua vita :(". This translation maintains the emotional tone of
#. the original sentence, indicating that the link is no longer functional or
#. accessible due to being "dead". The colon and exclamation mark are
#. preserved in their semantic location within the Italian text.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:26
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Can not validate a dead link..."
msgstr "Il collegamento ha vissuto la sua vita :(\"."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request Another one" translates to Italian
#. as "Chiedere un altro," which means "to ask for another." This translation
#. maintains the meaning, tone, and nuance of the original English sentence.
#. In this case, there are no placeholders or HTML markers to consider, so
#. they remain in their original positions within the translated text.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:35
msgid "Request Another one"
msgstr "Chiedere un altro"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email for Verification"
#. translates to Italian as "Richiedi un nuovo indirizzo email per la
#. verifica," which literally means "Request a new email address for
#. verification." In this context, the term "email" refers to an electronic
#. mail address used for communication. The Italian translation preserves the
#. meaning and tone of the original English sentence while adhering to proper
#. grammar and punctuation.
#. HTML markers: "<h1>Request New Email for Verification</h1>"

#. nuovo indirizzo email"
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:18
msgid "Request New Email for Verification"
msgstr "Richiedi un nuovo indirizzo email per la verifica."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email" translates to Italian
#. as "Richiedi un nuovo indirizzo email," which literally means "Request a
#. new address email." In this context, the term "email" is used
#. interchangeably with "indirizzo email," where "indirizzo" refers to an
#. email address. The translation maintains this equivalence while preserving
#. the meaning and tone of the original English sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:28
msgid "Request New Email"
msgstr "Richiedi un nuovo indirizzo email"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the user's app should
#. adjust a specific template. This is accurately translated into Italian as
#. "Di solito, questo modello deve essere modificato dal tuo stesso template
#. dell'applicazione," which conveys the same meaning in Italian.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:33
msgid "Usually this template needs to be changed by your own app's template"
msgstr ""
"Di solito, questo modello deve essere modificato dal tuo stesso template "
"dell'applicazione"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Method not allowed" indicates that the
#. requested action is forbidden, which translates directly to Italian as
#. "Metodo non consentito." This maintains the meaning and tone of the
#. original sentence.
#. ```
#. "Metodo non consentito"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:48
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Metodo non consentito"

#. Explanation: The Italian translation for "Verification Successful!" is
#. "Verifica effettuata con successo!". This maintains the positive tone and
#. affirmative nature of the English sentence, indicating that a verification
#. process has been completed successfully.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:60
msgid "Verification Successful!"
msgstr "Verifica effettuata con successo!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "There is something wrong with this
#. link..." implies that the user has identified a problem or issue with a
#. specific link. This meaning is preserved in the Italian translation, "C'è
#. qualcosa che non va con questo collegamento...", where "qualcosa" means
#. "something," and "che non va" translates to "that doesn't work." The phrase
#. "with this link" is maintained as "con questo collegamento" in Italian.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:74
msgid "There is something wrong with this link..."
msgstr "C'è qualcosa che non va con questo collegamento..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Failed!" translates to
#. Italian as "Verifica fallita!". This translation maintains the negative
#. connotation of the original English sentence, indicating that a
#. verification process has not been successful. The Italian word order is
#. preserved for clarity and naturalness.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:75
msgid "Verification Failed!"
msgstr "Verifica fallita!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The link has lived its life :( Request a
#. new one!" conveys the idea that the link is no longer functional and needs
#. to be replaced. This sentiment is preserved in the Italian translation,
#. where "Il collegamento ha vissuto la sua vita :(" translates to "Il
#. collegamento ha vissuto la sua vita :(," emphasizing its past
#. functionality, and "Richiedere uno nuovo!" mirrors the English phrase's
#. call for a new link. The Italian translation maintains the tone of urgency
#. and the need for replacement, just as the French translation does in the
#. context provided.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:83
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Request a new one!"
msgstr "Il collegamento ha vissuto la sua vita :(\" Richiedere uno nuovo!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Expired!" conveys the same meaning as the
#. French "Expiré!". Both indicate that something has passed its due date or
#. time. In Italian, "Scaduto!" is used to express this idea, maintaining the
#. original tone and nuance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:84
msgid "Expired!"
msgstr "Scaduto!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This link was modified before
#. verification" indicates that the link's content or structure underwent
#. changes prior to being checked for accuracy. This is accurately translated
#. into Italian as "Questo collegamento è stato modificato prima della
#. verifica," where "questo" means "this," "collegamento" translates to
#. "link," and "è stato modificato" conveys the action of modification, while
#. "prima della verifica" maintains the timeframe before verification.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:94
msgid "This link was modified before verification."
msgstr "Questo collegamento è stato modificato prima della verifica."

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that it is not possible to
#. request another verification link due to the presence of a faulty link.
#. This meaning is preserved in the Italian translation, "Non è possibile
#. richiedere un altro link di verifica con il link difettoso," where "non è
#. possibile" translates to "it is not possible," "richiedere" means "to
#. request," "un altro" indicates "another," and "link di verifica"
#. corresponds to "verification link." The French phrase "avec un lien
#. défectueux" is translated as "con il link difettoso" in Italian,
#. maintaining the same meaning.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:95
msgid "Cannot request another verification link with faulty link."
msgstr ""
"Non è possibile richiedere un altro link di verifica con il link difettoso."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Faulty Link Detected!" translates to
#. Italian as "Link difettoso rilevato!". In this context, "rilevato" is the
#. past participle of the verb "rilevare", which means "to detect". This
#. maintains the meaning that a faulty link has been identified. The
#. exclamation mark at the end of the English phrase is preserved in Italian
#. as well, indicating urgency or importance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:96
msgid "Faulty Link Detected!"
msgstr "Link difettoso rilevato!"

#. Explanation: This Italian translation maintains the meaning, tone, and
#. nuance of the original English sentence. The phrase "You have exceeded the
#. maximum verification requests!" is translated as "hai superato il numero
#. massimo di richieste di verifica!", which conveys the same idea that the
#. user has gone beyond the allowed limit for verification requests. The
#. instruction to "Contact admin" in English is translated as "Contatta
#. l'amministratore", preserving the intended action of reaching out to an
#. administrator.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:104 src/verify_email/views.py:193
msgid "You have exceeded the maximum verification requests! Contact admin."
msgstr ""
"Hai superato il numero massimo di richieste di verifica! Contatta "
"l'amministratore."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Maxed out!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has reached its limit or full capacity. In this context, the
#. Italian translation "Massimo!" conveys a similar meaning, emphasizing that
#. something has achieved its maximum level or extent.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:105 src/verify_email/views.py:194
msgid "Maxed out!"
msgstr "Massimo!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the provided link is
#. either invalid or has already been used. This meaning is preserved in the
#. Italian translation by using "non è valido" to express an invalid link and
#. "è stato già utilizzato" to indicate it's been previously used. The phrase
#. "non possiamo verificare la sua utilizzazione con questo link" translates
#. to "we cannot verify its usage with this link," maintaining the original
#. context.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:113 src/verify_email/views.py:202
msgid ""
"This link is invalid or been used already, we cannot verify using this link."
msgstr ""
"Questo link non è valido o è stato già utilizzato, non possiamo verificare "
"la sua utilizzazione con questo link."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invalid Link" translates to Italian as
#. "Link non valido," which directly conveys the same meaning. In this
#. context, "non valido" means "invalid." The French translation "Lien
#. invalide" also indicates an invalid link, so the Italian translation "Link
#. non valido" maintains consistency with that interpretation.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:114 src/verify_email/views.py:203
msgid "Invalid Link"
msgstr "Link non valido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "404 User not found" translates directly to
#. Italian as "404 Utente non trovato," preserving the number and the meaning
#. of the original sentence. In this case, there are no placeholders or HTML
#. markers to consider, so they remain in their original positions within the
#. translated text.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:118
msgid "404 User not found"
msgstr "404 Utente non trovato"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User is already active" indicates that the
#. user has been previously engaged or logged in. In Italian, this translates
#. to "L'utente è già attivo," which means "The user is already active." The
#. word order and verb tense are preserved to maintain the meaning of the
#. original sentence.
#. ```
#. "L'utente è già attivo."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:133
msgid "User is already active"
msgstr "L'utente è già attivo."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You have requested another verification
#. email!" translates to Italian as "Hai richiesto un'altra email di
#. conferma!". In this translation, the subject ("you") and verb ("have
#. requested") remain consistent with their original meanings. The phrase
#. "another verification email" is translated as "un'altra email di conferma",
#. where "email" directly translates to "email" and "verification" is implied
#. by the context of sending a confirmation message.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:142 src/verify_email/views.py:165
msgid "You have requested another verification email!"
msgstr "Hai richiesto un'altra email di conferma!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Your verification link has been sent"
#. conveys the action of sending a link for verification. In Italian, this
#. translates to "Il tuo link di verifica è stato inviato," which means "Your
#. verification link has been sent." The use of "il tuo" (your) and "link di
#. verifica" (verification link) maintains the original meaning while adhering
#. to Italian grammar rules.
#. HTML placeholder example:
#. ```
#. English sentence: "<p>You have received a new message from
#. %(sender_name)s</p>", French translation: "<p>Vous avez reçu un nouveau
#. message de %(sender_name)s</p>"
#. ```
#. Italian translation with placeholders:
#. ```
#. "<p>Hai ricevuto una nuova messaggio da %(sender_name)</p>"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:143 src/verify_email/views.py:166
msgid "Your verification link has been sent"
msgstr "Il tuo link di verifica è stato inviato."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Sent!" translates to Italian as
#. "Email inviato!". This is a straightforward translation where the verb
#. "sent" in English corresponds directly to the Italian verb "invio", which
#. means "to send". The exclamation mark remains unchanged, indicating that
#. this is an affirmative statement.
#. ```
#. "Email inviato!"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:144 src/verify_email/views.py:167
msgid "Email Sent!"
msgstr "Email inviato!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Something went wrong during sending email"
#. translates to Italian as "Qualcosa è andato storto durante la spedizione
#. dell'email". In this context, "something" refers to the issue encountered
#. while attempting to send an email. The Italian translation preserves this
#. meaning by using "qualcosa", which means "something". The colon and
#. parentheses in the original English sentence are maintained as placeholders
#. in the Italian translation.
#. ```
#. "Qualcosa è andato storto durante la spedizione dell'email :-)"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:171
msgid "Something went wrong during sending email :("
msgstr "Qualcosa è andato storto durante la spedizione dell'email :-)"

#. Explanation: This Italian translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that the user cannot be found linked to the given
#. email. The English sentence "User not found associated with given email!"
#. conveys a similar message, emphasizing the absence of a user tied to the
#. provided email address.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:175
msgid "User not found associated with given email!"
msgstr "Utente non trovato associato all'indirizzo email dato!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User Not Found" translates directly to
#. Italian as "Utente non trovato," which means the same thing. There is no
#. ambiguity in this translation, and it maintains the original meaning, tone,
#. and nuance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:177
msgid "User Not Found"
msgstr "Utente non trovato"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Internal server error!" translates to
#. Italian as "Errore di rete interna!". This reflects the meaning of the
#. French phrase, which indicates an internal network issue causing a problem
#. with the server. In this context, "errore" in Italian corresponds to
#. "erreur" in French, and "di rete" translates to "de réseau", both
#. indicating a network-related error.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:181 src/verify_email/views.py:185
msgid "Internal server error!"
msgstr "Errore di rete interna!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This user's account is already active"
#. indicates that the account of a specific individual (the 'this user') is
#. currently operational. This meaning is preserved in Italian as "Questo
#. utente ha già un'account attivo," where "questo utente" refers to the same
#. individual, and "un'account attivo" translates to "an already active
#. account."
#. ```
#. "Questo utente ha già un'account attivo."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:211
msgid "This user's account is already active"
msgstr "Questo utente ha già un'account attivo."

#. Explanation: The Italian translation for "Already Verified!" is "Già
#. verificato!". This reflects the meaning of the French phrase, which
#. indicates that something has been confirmed or checked. In this context, it
#. conveys a sense of completion or confirmation, similar to the English
#. original.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:212
msgid "Already Verified!"
msgstr "Già verificato!"
