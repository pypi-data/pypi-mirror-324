#. phrase, which indicates that the user's email verification was successful
#. and their account has been activated. The English sentence conveys a
#. similar message, emphasizing that the user can now log in using their

#. to Portuguese as "Confirmação do e-mail," preserving the meaning and

#. noun in Portuguese, just as it is in English. The translation reflects the
#. French equivalent "Confirmation de l'e-mail," which indicates that the
#. action of confirmation pertains to an email.

#. request to check the validity of an electronic mail address. In Portuguese,
#. this translates directly as "Por favor, verifique seu e-mail," which
#. maintains the same tone and formality. The French translation "Merci de

msgstr "Você se juntará a nós exatamente após a verificação."

#. Explanation: The English sentence is a polite greeting, acknowledging the
#. recipient's participation in an event or group. In this case, it's a mail
#. generated by a machine. The French translation accurately conveys this
#. meaning while maintaining the tone and formality of the original text. The
#. Portuguese translation follows suit, using "obrigado" for "thanks," "por se
#. juntar" for "for joining," and "este e-mail foi gerado por uma máquina" to
#. maintain the machine-generated aspect. The instruction to not respond is

#. the French phrase "Lien expiré!". Both indicate that a link has reached its
#. expiration date and is no longer functional. In Portuguese, this translates
#. to "Link Expirou!", which maintains the same tone and nuance of urgency and
#. finality. The use of exclamation marks in both English and French
#. emphasizes the importance of the message.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:20
msgid "Link Expired!"
msgstr "Link Expirou!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "The link has lived its life :( Can not
#. validate a dead link..." conveys that the link is no longer functional, as
#. indicated by the emoticon ":(". In Portuguese, this meaning is preserved
#. with "O link já viveu sua vida :(", where "já" means "has already" and
#. "viveu" means "lived". The phrase "Can not validate a dead link..."
#. translates to "Impossible de valider um lien mort...", where "impossível"
#. means "impossible", "valide" means "validate", and "um lien mort" is the
#. equivalent of "a dead link".
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:26

msgstr "O link já viveu sua vida :(\"."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request Another one" translates to

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email for Verification"
#. translates to Portuguese as "Solicitar um novo email para verificação."

#. translation, indicating that the action involves asking for a new email to
#. be used in the verification process.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:18
msgid "Request New Email for Verification"
msgstr "Solicitar um novo email para verificação"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email" translates to

#. asking for a new email address, with "solicit" in Portuguese conveying the
#. idea of making a request.

msgid "Request New Email"
msgstr "Solicitar um novo e-mail"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the template usually needs
#. to be modified by a specific app's template. This is accurately conveyed in
#. Portuguese as "normalmente, este modelo precisa ser alterado pelo seu
#. próprio template da aplicação," where "este modelo" translates to "this
#. model," and "precisa ser alterado" maintains the meaning of needing
#. modification. The phrase "pela sua própria template da aplicação" is a
#. direct translation of "by your own app's template."
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:33
msgid "Usually this template needs to be changed by your own app's template"
msgstr ""
"Normalmente, este modelo precisa ser alterado pelo seu próprio template da "

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Method not allowed" indicates that an
#. action or request is forbidden due to the method used. In this context,
#. "method" refers to a specific way of performing an action or making a
#. request. The French translation "Méthode interdite" directly conveys this
#. meaning, translating to "forbidden method". Therefore, the Portuguese
#. translation "Método não permitido" maintains the same nuance and preserves
#. the original intent.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:48
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Método não permitido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Successful!" translates
#. directly to Portuguese as "Verificação bem-sucedida!". This direct

msgid "Verification Successful!"
msgstr "Verificação bem-sucedida!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "There is something wrong with this
#. link..." conveys the idea that there's a problem or issue with a specific
#. link. In French, "Quelque chose ne va pas avec ce lien..." translates to
#. "Something is not right with this link...". This translation maintains the
#. meaning and tone of the original English sentence while preserving the
#. nuance of the French phrase. The Portuguese translation, "Há algo errado
#. com este link...", also conveys a similar sense of an issue or problem
#. associated with a particular link, ensuring consistency across languages.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:74
msgid "There is something wrong with this link..."
msgstr "Há algo errado com este link..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Failed!" translates directly
#. to Portuguese as "Verificação falhou!". This translation maintains the
#. negative connotation and the action of verification failing, preserving the
#. original meaning. The exclamation mark is also retained for emphasis in the
#. Portuguese version.

msgid "Verification Failed!"
msgstr "Verificação falhou!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that the link has served its
#. purpose and is no longer functional, expressed as "The link has lived its
#. life :(". This translates to Portuguese as "O link já passou por sua vida
#. :(", which maintains the emotional tone of the original. The phrase
#. "Request a new one!" in English is translated as "Solicite um novo!",
#. preserving the imperative mood and the request for a replacement.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:83
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Request a new one!"
msgstr "O link já passou por sua vida :(\". \"Solicite um novo!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Expired!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has passed its due date or time limit. In this case, the
#. Portuguese translation "Expirado!" conveys the same meaning, using the same
#. intonation and emphasis to express surprise or urgency.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:84
msgid "Expired!"
msgstr "Expirado!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This link was modified before
#. verification" indicates that the link's content or structure underwent
#. changes prior to being checked for accuracy. This meaning is preserved in
#. Portuguese as "Este link foi alterado antes da verificação," where "este"
#. translates to "this," "link" remains unchanged, "foi" means "was," and
#. "alterado" conveys the action of modification. The French translation "Ce
#. lien a été modifié avant vérification" is consistent with this Portuguese
#. translation, as both phrases indicate that the link underwent changes prior
#. to verification.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:94
msgid "This link was modified before verification."
msgstr "Este link foi alterado antes da verificação."

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that it is not feasible to
#. request another verification link due to the presence of a faulty link.
#. This meaning is preserved in Portuguese as "não é possível" (it is not
#. possible), and "solicitar um segundo link de verificação" (to request
#. another verification link) maintains the original structure. The French
#. translation "Impossible de demander un autre lien de vérification avec un
#. lien défectueux." is accurately translated into Portuguese as "não é
#. possível solicitar um segundo link de verificação com um lien defeituoso."
#: src/verify_email/views.py:95
msgid "Cannot request another verification link with faulty link."
msgstr ""
"Não é possível solicitar um segundo link de verificação com um link "
"defeituoso."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Faulty Link Detected!" translates to

#. means "faulty", and the exclamation mark is preserved in Portuguese.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:96
msgid "Faulty Link Detected!"
msgstr "Link defeituoso detectado!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence "You have exceeded the maximum
#. verification requests!" translates to Portuguese as "Você excedeu o limite
#. máximo de solicitações de verificação!", which conveys the same meaning of
#. exceeding a set limit for verification requests. The French translation "Tu
#. as dépassé le nombre maximum de demandes de vérification ! Contacte
#. l'administrateur." is accurately translated to Portuguese as "Você excedeu
#. o limite máximo de solicitações de verificação! Entre em contato com o
#. administrador." The use of "excedeu" in Portuguese maintains the same
#. connotation of exceeding a limit, and "contacte" is translated to "entre em
#. contato", both meaning "to contact".
#: src/verify_email/views.py:104 src/verify_email/views.py:193
msgid "You have exceeded the maximum verification requests! Contact admin."
msgstr ""
"Você excedeu o limite máximo de solicitações de verificação! Entre em "

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Maxed out!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has reached its limit or capacity, often used in the context
#. of credit cards. In Portuguese, this meaning is preserved by translating it
#. as "Maximizado!", where "maximizado" means "maximized".
#. ```

#. invalid or has already been used. This meaning is preserved in Portuguese
#. as "Este link não é válido ou já foi usado," which translates to "This link

#. this link" is conveyed by "não podemos verificar usando este link," which
#. means "we cannot verify with this link."
#: src/verify_email/views.py:113 src/verify_email/views.py:202
msgid ""
"This link is invalid or been used already, we cannot verify using this link."
msgstr ""
"Este link não é válido ou já foi usado, não podemos verificar usando este "
"link."

#. Portuguese as "Link inválido," which maintains the same meaning and tone.
#. No ambiguity exists between the two languages, so no additional explanation
#. is required.

msgid "Invalid Link"
msgstr "Link inválido"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "404 User not found" translates directly to
#. Portuguese as "404 Usuário não encontrado," preserving the number and the
#. meaning of the original sentence. In this case, there are no placeholders
#. or HTML markers that need special attention, so they remain in their
#. original positions.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:118
msgid "404 User not found"
msgstr "404 Usuário não encontrado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User is already active" indicates that the
#. user has been previously engaged or logged in. In Portuguese, this
#. translates to "O usuário já está ativo," where "O usuário" means "the user"
#. and "está ativo" means "is already active."

#. "O usuário já está ativo."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:133
msgid "User is already active"
msgstr "O usuário já está ativo."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You have requested another verification
#. email!" translates to Portuguese as "Você pediu outro e-mail de
#. verificação!". In this translation, the subject ("you") remains consistent
#. with the French context, which is "Tu" (French for "you"). The verb "have
#. requested" in English corresponds to "pedir" in Portuguese and "demandé" in
#. French. The phrase "another verification email" translates directly into
#. Portuguese as "outro e-mail de verificação", preserving the meaning of
#. sending a second confirmation email for security purposes.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:142 src/verify_email/views.py:165
msgid "You have requested another verification email!"
msgstr "Você pediu outro e-mail de verificação!"

#. Explanation: This Portuguese translation reflects the meaning of the French
#. phrase, which indicates that a verification link was sent. The English
#. sentence is straightforward and does not contain any ambiguity regarding
#. the action performed (sending a link). Therefore, the Portuguese version "O
#. seu link de verificação foi enviado" directly conveys this information
#. while maintaining the original tone and nuance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:143 src/verify_email/views.py:166
msgid "Your verification link has been sent"
msgstr "O seu link de verificação foi enviado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Sent!" translates to Portuguese as
#. "E-mail enviado!". In this context, the exclamation mark indicates a
#. positive action has been completed. The translation maintains this
#. affirmative tone and nuance in Portuguese by using "enviado" instead of
#. "enviada", which is the feminine form for "sent".
#: src/verify_email/views.py:144 src/verify_email/views.py:167
msgid "Email Sent!"
msgstr "E-mail enviado!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Something went wrong during sending email
#. :" is translated into Portuguese as "Algo deu errado ao enviar o e-mail
#. :(". This translation maintains the negative sentiment and the context of
#. an issue occurring while sending an email. The colon and parentheses are
#. preserved in their original positions, reflecting the structure of the
#. English phrase.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:171
msgid "Something went wrong during sending email :("
msgstr "Algo deu errado ao enviar o e-mail :-("

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User not found associated with given
#. email!" translates to Portuguese as "Usuário não encontrado associado às
#. informações de e-mail fornecidas!". This translation maintains the meaning
#. of the original sentence, indicating that a user cannot be located when
#. linked to the provided email. The French context "Utilisateur non trouvé
#. associé à l'email donné !" is consistent with this Portuguese translation,
#. both conveying the idea that an associated user could not be identified
#. based on the given email address.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:175
msgid "User not found associated with given email!"
msgstr "Usuário não encontrado associado às informações de e-mail fornecidas!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User Not Found" translates directly to
#. Portuguese as "Usuário não encontrado," which maintains the same meaning
#. and tone. No ambiguity exists in this translation, as both languages convey
#. the exact message of a user not being located or found.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:177
msgid "User Not Found"
msgstr "Usuário não encontrado"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Internal server error!" is a colloquial
#. way to indicate that there has been an unexpected issue with the server,
#. causing it to fail or behave erratically. This translation reflects this
#. meaning in Portuguese as "Erro Interno do Servidor!". The exclamation mark
#. remains unchanged, emphasizing the urgency of the message.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:181 src/verify_email/views.py:185
msgid "Internal server error!"
msgstr "Erro Interno do Servidor!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This user's account is already active"
#. indicates that the user has an existing, functioning account. In
#. Portuguese, this meaning is preserved by translating "user's account" as
#. "cuenta do usuário," and "already active" as "já tem sua conta ativa."
#. ```
#. "Este usuário já tem sua conta ativa."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:211
msgid "This user's account is already active"
msgstr "Este usuário já tem sua conta ativa."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Already Verified!" translates to
#. Portuguese as "Já Verificado!". This translation maintains the affirmative
