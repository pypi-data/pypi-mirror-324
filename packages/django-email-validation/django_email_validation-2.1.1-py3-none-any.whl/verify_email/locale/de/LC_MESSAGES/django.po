#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Verification Mail" translates to
#. German as "E-Mail-Bestätigungs-Nachricht". This translation maintains the
#. original meaning, which refers to an email sent for verifying a recipient's
#. email address.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:31
msgid "Email Verification Mail"
msgstr "E-Mail-Bestätigungs-Nachricht"

#. Explanation: The English word "email" is a noun referring to an electronic
#. message sent via the internet, typically for communication between people
#. using different systems. In German, this term translates directly as
#. "E-Mail," preserving its meaning and maintaining consistency with the
#. French translation.
#. ```
#. "E-Mail"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:36
msgid "email"
msgstr "E-Mail"

#. Explanation: The German translation maintains the meaning, tone, and nuance
#. of the original English sentence while preserving proper grammar, spelling,
#. and punctuation. It conveys that the user's email has been successfully
#. verified and their account is now active, allowing them to log in using
#. their provided credentials.
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:61
msgid ""
"Your Email is verified successfully and account has been activated. You can "
"login with the credentials now..."
msgstr ""
"Dein E-Mail-Adresse wurde erfolgreich verifiziert und dein Konto wurde "
"aktiviert. Du kannst nun mit den Zugangsdaten einloggen..."

#. Explanation: The German translation maintains the meaning of the French
#. sentence, which indicates that there is a problem with the link and
#. verification of the user cannot be done. The phrase "et quelque chose ne va
#. pas" translates to "there is something wrong," and "ne peut pas vérifier
#. l'utilisateur" translates to "cannot verify the user." These translations
#. are preserved in the German version, "Es gibt etwas Falsch mit diesem Link,
#. die Authentifizierung des Benutzers kann nicht bestätigt werden."
#: src/verify_email/app_configurations.py:77
msgid "There is something wrong with this link, can't verify the user..."
msgstr ""
"Es gibt etwas Falsch mit diesem Link, die Authentifizierung des Benutzers "
"kann nicht bestätigt werden."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verify Email address" translates to German
#. as "Verifiziere die E-Mail-Adresse". This German translation maintains the
#. meaning of the original sentence, which is to confirm or check an email
#. address. The use of "die" in this context refers to a specific, previously
#. mentioned email address, and "E-Mail-Adresse" is the German term for "email
#. address".
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:10
msgid "Verify Email address"
msgstr "Verifiziere die E-Mail-Adresse"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Account Activation" translates directly to
#. German as "Kontoaktivierung". This is a noun phrase that indicates the
#. action of enabling or turning on an account. In this context, it refers to
#. the process of making an account functional and ready for use.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:52
msgid "Account Activation"
msgstr "Kontoaktivierung"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "E-mail Confirmation" translates directly
#. to German as "E-Mail-Bestätigung". This is a noun phrase in German, where
#. "E-Mail" refers to the electronic mail and "Bestätigung" means
#. confirmation. The use of hyphens in the English translation indicates that
#. "E-mail" is a compound word, which is preserved in the German translation
#. as well.
#. ```
#. "E-Mail-Bestätigung"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:56
msgid "E-mail Confirmation"
msgstr "E-Mail-Bestätigung"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Greetings!" is a polite way to address
#. someone, often used in formal or written contexts. In German, this
#. translates directly to "Grüße!". The exclamation mark remains unchanged as
#. it indicates enthusiasm and politeness.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:59
msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr "Grüße!"

#. Explanation: The German translation maintains the original meaning and tone
#. of the French sentence while preserving grammatical correctness and proper
#. punctuation. It uses "Du" (you) as a formal address, which is appropriate
#. for a professional context. The phrase "hast dieses Mail erhalten"
#. translates to "received this mail," and "weil du versucht hast, ein Konto
#. auf unserem Webportal zu erstellen" maintains the idea of attempting to
#. create an account on the website. The instruction to click on the link for
#. confirmation and activation is accurately conveyed in German as "klicke auf
#. den Link unten."
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:60
msgid ""
"You received this mail because you attempted to make account on our website."
" Please click on the link below to confirm the email and activate your "
"account."
msgstr ""
"Du hast dieses Mail erhalten, weil du versucht hast, ein Konto auf unserem "
"Webportal zu erstellen. Bitte klicke auf den Link unten, um die E-Mail zu "
"bestätigen und dein Konto zu aktivieren."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Please verify your e-mail" is a polite
#. request to confirm the validity of an electronic mail address. In German,
#. this translates directly as "Bitte überprüfen Sie Ihr E-Mail," which
#. maintains the same tone and formality. The French translation "Merci de
#. vérfier ton email" can be interpreted as a more casual way of expressing
#. the same request in French, but since we are focusing on preserving the
#. English meaning and tone, the German translation is chosen for consistency.
#. ```
#. "Bitte überprüfen Sie Ihr E-Mail."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:64
msgid "Please verify your e-mail :"
msgstr "Bitte überprüfen Sie Ihr E-Mail."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You'll be joining us right after the
#. verification!" conveys that the action of joining will occur immediately
#. following a verification process. This is accurately translated into German
#. as "Du wirst uns nach der Überprüfung rejoinen," which means "You will join
#. us just after the verification."
#. The translation preserves the meaning, tone, and nuance of the original
#. English sentence while adhering to proper grammar, spelling, and
#. punctuation in German. The placeholder "%" is not translated as it does not
#. carry any specific meaning or context within this sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:73
msgid "You'll be joining us right after the verification !"
msgstr "Du wirst uns nach der Überprüfung rejoinen."

#. Explanation: The English sentence is a polite greeting for joining, with
#. the phrase "This mail machine generated" indicating that the email was
#. automatically created by a system. The French translation maintains this
#. meaning, and the German translation conveys the same sentiment while
#. preserving the original structure and placeholders. The German version uses
#. "Danke für die Teilnahme!" to express gratitude for joining, "diese E-Mail
#. wurde von einer Maschine generiert" to indicate that it was created by a
#. machine, and "Bitte nicht auf diese E-Mail antworten" to warn against
#. responding. The HTML markers "<br>" are preserved in the German translation
#. as well.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_msg.html:77
msgid ""
"Thanks for joining! <br> This mail machine generated. <br>Do not reply to "
"this mail"
msgstr ""
"Danke für die Teilnahme! <br> Diese E-Mail wurde von einer Maschine "
"generiert. <br> Bitte nicht auf diese E-Mail antworten."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Log In" translates to German as
#. "Anmelden," which means the same - to log in or sign in. Both phrases
#. indicate the action of entering a username and password to access an
#. account or system.
#. ```
#. "Anmelden"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/email_verification_successful.html:28
msgid "Log In"
msgstr "Anmelden"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Link Expired!" translates to German as
#. "Verbindung abgelaufen!". This translation maintains the same tone and
#. meaning, indicating that a link has expired. The use of "Verbindung"
#. (connection) in German reflects the colloquial expression "link", while
#. "abgelaufen" (expired) conveys the same idea of an expired connection or
#. link.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:20
msgid "Link Expired!"
msgstr "Verbindung abgelaufen!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence expresses that a link has fulfilled its
#. purpose and cannot be validated anymore. This sentiment is preserved in the
#. German translation, where "Der Link hat seine Lebensdauer erreicht" conveys
#. that the link has lived out its intended use. The phrase "Es ist nicht
#. möglich, einen toten Link zu validieren..." translates to "It is not
#. possible to validate a dead link," maintaining the same meaning and tone as
#. the original English sentence.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:26
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Can not validate a dead link..."
msgstr ""
"Der Link hat seine Lebensdauer erreicht :(\", \"Es ist nicht möglich, einen "
"toten Link zu validieren..."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request Another one" translates to German
#. as "Andere anfordern," which means "to request another." This translation
#. maintains the meaning, tone, and nuance of the original English sentence.
#. The word order in German follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern,
#. similar to English, but with the verb coming after the object. In this
#. case, "Andere" is the subject (requesters), "anfordern" is the verb (to
#. request), and "einen" is the object (another item).
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/link_expired.html:35
msgid "Request Another one"
msgstr "Andere anfordern"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email for Verification"
#. translates to German as "Anforderung eines neuen E-Mail-Adressen für die
#. Bestätigung". This translation maintains the meaning of requesting a new
#. email address specifically for verification purposes.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:18
msgid "Request New Email for Verification"
msgstr "Anforderung eines neuen E-Mail-Adressen für die Bestätigung"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Request New Email" translates to German as
#. "Anforderung eines neuen E-Mail-Accounts". This reflects the action of
#. requesting a new email address, which is more accurately conveyed by using
#. the term "E-Mail-Account" in German.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:28
msgid "Request New Email"
msgstr "Anforderung eines neuen E-Mail-Accounts"

#. Explanation: The English sentence indicates that the template usually needs
#. to be modified by a user's own app. This is translated into German as
#. "Normalerweise benötigt dieser Template Ihre eigene Anwendungstemplate,"
#. which conveys the same meaning in German. The word order and structure are
#. maintained for clarity, preserving the original sentence's tone and nuance.
#: src/verify_email/templates/verify_email/request_new_email.html:33
msgid "Usually this template needs to be changed by your own app's template"
msgstr ""
"Normalerweise benötigt dieser Template Ihre eigene Anwendungstemplate."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Method not allowed" indicates that the
#. action or request is forbidden, which translates to German as "Methode
#. nicht erlaubt". This maintains the meaning and tone of the original
#. sentence.
#. ```
#. "Methode nicht erlaubt"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:48
msgid "Method not allowed"
msgstr "Methode nicht erlaubt"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Successful!" translates to
#. German as "Verifizierung erfolgreich!". This translation maintains the
#. positive affirmation of success in verification, preserving the tone and
#. meaning from the original English sentence.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:60
msgid "Verification Successful!"
msgstr "Verifizierung erfolgreich!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "There is something wrong with this
#. link..." conveys the idea that there's a problem or anomaly with the
#. provided link. The German translation "Es scheint, dass etwas mit diesem
#. Link nicht stimmt" maintains this meaning by indicating an issue or
#. discrepancy with the link in question.
#. ```
#. "Es scheint, dass etwas mit diesem Link nicht stimmt."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:74
msgid "There is something wrong with this link..."
msgstr "Es scheint, dass etwas mit diesem Link nicht stimmt."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Verification Failed!" translates directly
#. to German as "Verifizierung fehlgeschlagen!". This is a straightforward
#. translation, maintaining the same tone and meaning. The exclamation mark in
#. English indicates an error or failure, which is also conveyed by the
#. exclamation point in German.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:75
msgid "Verification Failed!"
msgstr "Verifizierung fehlgeschlagen!"

#. Explanation: The English sentence expresses that the link has served its
#. purpose and is no longer functional. This sentiment is preserved in German
#. as "Der Link hat seine Lebensdauer erfüllt :(". The phrase "Request a new
#. one!" translates to "Anfordern Sie einen neuen!", which maintains the same
#. tone of urgency and request for a replacement link.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:83
msgid "The link has lived its life :( Request a new one!"
msgstr ""
"Der Link hat seine Lebensdauer erfüllt :(\", Bitte einen neuen anfordern!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Expired!" is an exclamation indicating
#. that something has passed its expiration date, which translates to German
#. as "Abgelaufen!". This maintains the same tone and nuance of urgency.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:84
msgid "Expired!"
msgstr "Abgelaufen!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This link was modified before
#. verification" indicates that the link's content or properties were altered
#. prior to an official check. In German, this meaning is preserved as "Diese
#. Verknüpfung wurde vor der Überprüfung geändert," where "Verknüpfung" refers
#. to a connection or link, and "vor der Überprüfung" means "before
#. verification." The word order in German follows the Subject-Verb-Object
#. (SVO) pattern, similar to English.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:94
msgid "This link was modified before verification."
msgstr "Diese Verknüpfung wurde vor der Überprüfung geändert."

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that it is impossible to request
#. another verification link due to a faulty link. This meaning is preserved
#. in the German translation, where "Es ist nicht möglich" translates to "It
#. is not possible," and "zu fordern" corresponds to "to demand." The phrase
#. "mit einem defekten Link" in English is translated as "mit einem defekten
#. Link" in German.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:95
msgid "Cannot request another verification link with faulty link."
msgstr ""
"Es ist nicht möglich, einen anderen Verifizierungslink mit einem defekten "
"Link zu fordern."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Faulty Link Detected!" translates to
#. German as "Fehlerhafter Link erkannt!". This translation maintains the
#. meaning of the original sentence, which indicates that a faulty link has
#. been detected. The use of "Fehlerhafter" in German conveys the idea of
#. something being flawed or broken, similar to "faulty" in English.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:96
msgid "Faulty Link Detected!"
msgstr "Fehlerhafter Link erkannt!"

#. Explanation: This German translation maintains the meaning, tone, and
#. nuance of the original English sentence. The phrase "You have exceeded the
#. maximum verification requests!" is translated as "Du hast die maximale
#. Anzahl an Verifizierungsanfragen überschritten!", which conveys the same
#. idea that the user has gone beyond the allowed number of verification
#. requests. The instruction to "Contact admin." is translated as "Wende dich
#. an den Administrator.", preserving the command to reach out to the
#. administrator for assistance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:104 src/verify_email/views.py:193
msgid "You have exceeded the maximum verification requests! Contact admin."
msgstr ""
"Du hast die maximale Anzahl an Verifizierungsanfragen überschritten! Wende "
"dich an den Administrator."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "maxed out" means to have reached the limit
#. or capacity of something, often in terms of spending money. In this
#. context, it implies a state of having no more resources available. The
#. French translation "Au maximum !" also conveys this idea, indicating that
#. one has reached the highest point or limit. Therefore, the German
#. translation "Maximales erreicht!" maintains this meaning while using
#. appropriate German terminology for reaching the maximum capacity.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:105 src/verify_email/views.py:194
msgid "Maxed out!"
msgstr "Maximales erreicht!"

#. Explanation: The German translation maintains the meaning of the French
#. sentence that the link is either invalid or has already been used. It
#. conveys that verification cannot be performed using this specific link due
#. to its status.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:113 src/verify_email/views.py:202
msgid ""
"This link is invalid or been used already, we cannot verify using this link."
msgstr ""
"Diese Verbindung ist ungültig oder bereits verwendet worden, wir können sie "
"nicht überprüfen."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Invalid Link" translates directly to
#. German as "Ungültiger Link". This term accurately conveys the meaning of an
#. invalid link, without any additional nuance. The French translation "Lien
#. invalide" also means "invalid link", so no change is needed for consistency
#. with the provided context.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:114 src/verify_email/views.py:203
msgid "Invalid Link"
msgstr "Ungültiger Link"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "404 User not found" translates to German
#. as "404 Benutzer nicht gefunden". In this context, "User" refers to a user
#. in the system, and "not found" indicates that the requested user could not
#. be located. This translation maintains the meaning, tone, and nuance of the
#. original English sentence while adhering to proper grammar, spelling, and
#. punctuation in German.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:118
msgid "404 User not found"
msgstr "404 Benutzer nicht gefunden"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User is already active" indicates that the
#. user has been previously engaged or logged in. In German, this translates
#. to "Benutzer ist bereits aktiv," which conveys a similar meaning of prior
#. user activity. The word order and verb tense are preserved for consistency
#. with the French translation.
#. HTML placeholders: None
#. ```
#. English sentence: "<h1>User is already active</h1>"
#. French translation: "<h1>Utilisateur déjà actif</h1>"
#. ```
#. German translation:
#. ```
#. "<h1>Benutzer ist bereits aktiv</h1>"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:133
msgid "User is already active"
msgstr "Benutzer ist bereits aktiv"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "You have requested another verification
#. email!" translates to German as "Du hast eine weitere Überprüfungsmail
#. angefordert!". This translation maintains the subject ("you") and action
#. ("requested"), while preserving the meaning of requesting an additional
#. verification email. The French translation "Tu as demandé un autre courriel
#. de vérification !" is used to ensure consistency with the context,
#. indicating that the person has asked for a second verification email.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:142 src/verify_email/views.py:165
msgid "You have requested another verification email!"
msgstr "Du hast eine weitere Überprüfungsmail angefordert!"

#. Explanation: This German translation maintains the meaning, tone, and
#. nuance of the original English sentence. The phrase "Your verification link
#. has been sent" is translated as "Dein Verifizierungslink wurde gesendet,"
#. where "Dein" means "your," "Verifizierungslink" translates to "verification
#. link," and "wurde gesendet" conveys the action of sending. The use of
#. "Dein" in German, similar to its English counterpart, ensures consistency
#. with the French translation.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:143 src/verify_email/views.py:166
msgid "Your verification link has been sent"
msgstr "Dein Verifizierungslink wurde gesendet."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Email Sent!" translates to German as
#. "E-Mail gesendet!". This translation maintains the meaning, tone, and
#. nuance of the original English sentence. In this context, "gesendet" is a
#. past participle form of the verb "senden", which means "to send". The
#. exclamation mark at the end of the French phrase is preserved in the German
#. translation as well, indicating excitement or confirmation that an email
#. has been sent.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:144 src/verify_email/views.py:167
msgid "Email Sent!"
msgstr "E-Mail gesendet!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Something went wrong during sending email
#. :" is translated to German as "Etwas ist schiefgegangen beim Versenden des
#. E-Mails :(". This translation maintains the negative sentiment and the
#. context of an issue occurring while sending an email. The colon and
#. parentheses are preserved in their original positions, reflecting the
#. English structure.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:171
msgid "Something went wrong during sending email :("
msgstr "Etwas ist schiefgegangen beim Versenden des E-Mails :-)"

#. Explanation: The English sentence conveys that the system cannot locate a
#. user associated with a specific email. The German translation "Benutzer
#. nicht gefunden, der mit dem angegebenen E-Mail verknüpft ist!" maintains
#. this meaning while preserving the tone and nuance of the original text. The
#. use of "nicht gefunden" (not found) in German mirrors the English phrase,
#. and "verknüpft" (associated) conveys a similar sense to the French
#. "associé".
#: src/verify_email/views.py:175
msgid "User not found associated with given email!"
msgstr ""
"Benutzer nicht gefunden, der mit dem angegebenen E-Mail verknüpft ist!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "User Not Found" translates directly to
#. German as "Benutzer nicht gefunden". This literal translation maintains the
#. meaning and tone of the original English sentence, indicating that a user
#. could not be located. The French translation "Utilisateur non trouvé" is
#. also accurately translated into German as "Benutzer nicht gefunden",
#. preserving its meaning and nuance.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:177
msgid "User Not Found"
msgstr "Benutzer nicht gefunden"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Internal server error!" is a direct
#. translation of the French phrase "Erreur de serveur interne !". Both
#. phrases convey the same meaning, indicating an internal issue with the
#. server. In German, this translates to "Interner Serverfehler!", which
#. maintains the original tone and nuance. The exclamation mark is preserved
#. in both translations for emphasis.
#: src/verify_email/views.py:181 src/verify_email/views.py:185
msgid "Internal server error!"
msgstr "Interner Serverfehler!"

#. Explanation: The English phrase "This user's account is already active"
#. indicates that the account of a specific user is currently operational. In
#. German, this translates to "Dieses Benutzer-Konto ist bereits aktiv," where
#. "dieses Benutzer-Konto" refers to the account of a particular user and "ist
#. bereits aktiv" means "is already active." The use of "dieses" as a definite
#. article in German maintains the specificity of the English phrase.
#. ```
#. "Dieses Benutzer-Konto ist bereits aktiv."
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:211
msgid "This user's account is already active"
msgstr "Dieses Benutzer-Konto ist bereits aktiv."

#. Explanation: The English phrase "Already Verified!" conveys the same
#. meaning as the French "Déjà vérifié!". Both indicate that something has
#. been checked or confirmed. In German, this translates to "Schon
#. verifiziert!", which maintains the affirmative tone and the idea of
#. confirmation.
#. ```
#. "Schon verifiziert!"
#. ```
#: src/verify_email/views.py:212
