# Introduction

This package provides a common way to read and write [Pyut](https://github.com/hasii2011/pyut) XML files.  Additionally, it removes this code from 
Pyut and places in a new package, so we can easily version the library.  Furthermore, it allows
the development of an IOXml plugin for Pyut with common code.

I am concerned with the direction GitHub's Copilot project.

I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there, I do not like that
a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.
But I continue to monitor their terms of service.

I do not consent to any use of this project's code by the GitHub Copilot project it is done without my permission.
