Generate template and extract variables from texts.
In other words, template-analysis makes reverse template (untemplate).

## Usage

Currently, this supports to analyze only two texts.

```python
from template_analysis import analyze
result = analyze([
    "A dog is a good pet",
    "A cat is a good pet",
    "A cat is a pretty pet",
    "A bird is a great pet",
])
result.to_format_string()  # => "A {} is a {} pet"
result.args[0]  # => ["dog", "good"]
result.args[1]  # => ["cat", "good"]
result.args[2]  # => ["cat", "pretty"]
result.args[3]  # => ["bird", "great"]
```

## Concepts / Future plans

### Development plans

- [x] 1. Untemplate two texts.
- [x] 2. Untemplate multiple / complex texts.
- [ ] 3. Untemplate nested / tree-structured texts.
- [ ] 4. Support several features for scraping.
- [ ] 5. Implement a more efficient algorithm.
