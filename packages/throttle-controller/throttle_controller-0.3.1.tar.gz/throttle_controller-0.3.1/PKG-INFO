## Motivation

This package provides a simple throttle controller for general use-cases.
For example, you can use this package to throttle API requests to avoid rate-limiting.

## Usage

```python
from throttle_controller import SimpleThrottleController

throttle = SimpleThrottleController.create(default_cooldown_time=3.0)
throttle.wait_if_needed("http://example.com/path/to/api")
throttle.record_use_time_as_now("http://example.com/path/to/api")
... # requests
throttle.wait_if_needed("http://example.com/path/to/api")  # wait 3.0 seconds
throttle.record_use_time_as_now("http://example.com/path/to/api")
```

### `with` statement

```python
from throttle_controller import SimpleThrottleController
throttle = SimpleThrottleController.create(default_cooldown_time=3.0)

for _ in range(10):
    with throttle.use("http://example.com/path/to/api"):
        # wait if cooldown needed
        requests.get("http://example.com/path/to/api")
```

# Caution

Currently this package supports only to use in single thread / single process use-cases.
