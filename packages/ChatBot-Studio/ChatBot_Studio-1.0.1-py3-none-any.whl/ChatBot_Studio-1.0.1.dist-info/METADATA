    {"question": "Can you provide more details?", "responses": ["Yes", "No"]},
]

flow = create_conversational_flow("Customer Support", steps)
print(flow)
```

### 2. Integrating an NLP Model

```python
from ChatBot_Studio.core.model_integration import integrate_model

model = integrate_model("distilbert-base-uncased", task="text-classification")
print(model("I love this product!"))
```

### 3. Training the Bot

```python
