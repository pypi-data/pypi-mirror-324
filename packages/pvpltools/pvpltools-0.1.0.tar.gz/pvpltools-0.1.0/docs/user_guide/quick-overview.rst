Quick overview
==============

Currently, there are four groups of functions related to the topics:

- PV module efficiency: modeling efficiency as a function of irradiance and temperature
- power conversion: efficiency losses in inverters, but not limited to inverters
- energy rating: the (evolving) IEC-61853 method for rating PV modules
- DataPlusMeta: read and write columnar data together with important metadata in a human-readable text file
