# PV Performance Labs Tools for Python

*Useful tools for photovoltaics and beyond!*

This package, **pvpltools**, makes available a collection of useful
software components and functions created by Anton Driesse of PV Performance Labs.
Many were developed in the context of consulting or research projects,
sometimes as a necessity, and sometimes just to make life easier.

The aim of this package is to make life easier for people facing similar needs
and thereby, in a small way, support the accelerated deployment of photovoltaic power systems.

The current version of this package is found at https://github.com/pvplabs/pvpltools.
Prior to 2024, the code was made available at https://github.com/adriesse/pvpltools-python.
This older repository will remain in place, but will not be updated.

**pvpltools** is compatible with and complementary to
**pvlib python** (https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io).
