PV Performance Labs Tools for Python
=====================================

*Useful tools for photovoltaics and beyond!*

This package, **pvpltools**, makes available a collection of useful
software components and functions created by Anton Driesse of PV Performance Labs.
Many were developed in the context of consulting or research projects,
sometimes out of necessity, and sometimes just to make life easier.

The aim of this package is to make life easier for other people facing similar needs
and thereby, in a small way, support the accelerated deployment of photovoltaic power systems.

The current version of this package is found in the GitHub repository
`pvplabs/pvpltools <https://github.com/pvplabs/pvpltools>`_ .
Prior to 2024, the code was made available in
`adriesse/pvpltools-python <https://github.com/adriesse/pvpltools-python>`_ .
This older repository will remain in place, but will not be updated.

**pvpltools** is compatible with and complementary to
`pvlib python <https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io>`_.
