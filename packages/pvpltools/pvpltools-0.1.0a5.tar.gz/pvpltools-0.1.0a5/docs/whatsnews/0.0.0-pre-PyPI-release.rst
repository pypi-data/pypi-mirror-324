Historical notes
----------------


2024-02-13
^^^^^^^^^^

* More proof that these tools are useful!
  The module efficiency functions were put to good use in
  `this new study by Lelia Deville and her colleagues
  <https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3763>`_.


2021-10-17
^^^^^^^^^^

* New module ``power_conversion``, which introduces a function for calculating the ADR inverter model coefficients and more.


2021-08-11
^^^^^^^^^^

* The IEC 61853 spectral factor function has a new option ``integration_limit``.  Explanations are provided in the doc string.


2020-12-02
^^^^^^^^^^

* Seven models and a model fitting function are now available, and the example code shows how to fit them to data and calculate rms error for comparisons.
  And of course there are nice graphs.

* The new module ``module_efficiency.py`` contains functions for:

    - the new ADR model
    - HEY
    - MotherPV
    - PVGIS
    - MPM5
    - MPM6
    - bilinear
    - fitting any of the models to measurements


2020-02-29
^^^^^^^^^^

* The main building blocks for the Energy Rating calculation are complete.
* A higher level function of example script may be coming some day.
