"""Extensions for `commition`.

Extensions make it possible to use `commition` with other tools,
frameworks, or libraries. Sometimes they are an entrypoints
used by another program to get the version of the project.

Warning:
    To use the extensions, you need to install the corresponding packages
    or use an optional dependency defined by each extension (see their
    documentation for more information).

Warning:
    The extensions __will not__ be available without specific
    options, importing them directly will raise an ImportError.
