## Prerequisites

OpenOperator requires Python 3.11 or higher. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python environment management.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the OpenOperator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j0yk1ll/openoperator
cd openoperator
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install all dependencies including dev packages
uv pip install . ."[dev]"
```

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

<Note>
  You can use any LLM model supported by LangChain. See [LangChain
  Models](/customize/langchain-models) for available options and their specific
  API key requirements.
</Note>

## Development

After setup, you can:

- Try the examples in the `examples/` directory
- Run tests with `pytest`
