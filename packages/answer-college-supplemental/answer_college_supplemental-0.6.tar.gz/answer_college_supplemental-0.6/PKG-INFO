## Internals

- First, I created a Flask app as the backend and hosted it on Vercel. Since I use Google Gemini to create the essay response, I need to keep the Google Gemini API Key safe and secure, which isn't possible if I were to include it in the Python package.
- Second, I created the CLI tool using the built-in Argparse module to create the flag arguments. Then, I used requests to send a response to my Flask app, which calls Google Gemini. I send the Google Gemini response back to the CLI tool, which saves it to the output file.

## Installation

```console
pip install answer-college-supplemental
