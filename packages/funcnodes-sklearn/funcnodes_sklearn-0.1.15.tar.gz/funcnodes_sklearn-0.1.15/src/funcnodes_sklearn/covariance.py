    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, the support of robust location and covariance estimates

        If False, the robust location and covariance are directly computed
        with the FastMCD algorithm without additional treatment.

    support_fraction : float, default=None
        The proportion of points to be included in the support of the raw
        MCD estimate. If None, the minimum value of support_fraction will
        be used within the algorithm: `(n_samples + n_features + 1) / 2 * n_samples`.
        Range is (0, 1).

    contamination : float, default=0.1
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Range is (0, 0.5].

    support_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        A mask of the observations that have been used to compute the
        robust estimates of location and shape.

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to define the decision function from the raw scores.
        We have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.
        The offset depends on the contamination parameter and is defined in

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=0.01

    mode : {'cd', 'lars'}, default='cd'
        The Lasso solver to use: coordinate descent or LARS. Use LARS for
        very sparse underlying graphs, where p > n. Elsewhere prefer cd
        which is more numerically stable.

    covariance : "precomputed", default=None

        to be the covariance matrix. If `None`, the empirical covariance

    enet_tol : float, default=1e-4
        The tolerance for the elastic net solver used to calculate the descent
        direction. This parameter controls the accuracy of the search direction

        used for mode='cd'. Range is (0, inf].

    max_iter : int, default=100
        The maximum number of iterations.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        If verbose is True, the objective function and dual gap are
        plotted at each iteration.

    eps : float, default=eps
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, data are not centered before computation.

        - :term:`CV splitter`,

    Notes
    -----
    The search for the optimal penalization parameter (`alpha`) is done on an
    iteratively refined grid: first the cross-validated scores on a grid are
    computed, then a new refined grid is centered around the maximum, and so
    on.

    One of the challenges which is faced here is that the solvers can
    fail to converge to a well-conditioned estimate. The corresponding
    values of `alpha` then come out as missing values, but the optimum may
    be close to these missing values.

    In `fit`, once the best parameter `alpha` is found through
    cross-validation, the model is fit again using the entire training set.

    The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied

    drawn from a unimodal, symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used
    with multi-modal data (the algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is

    One should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal
    datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <robust_covariance>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, the support of the robust location and the covariance
        estimates is computed, and a covariance estimate is recomputed from
        it, without centering the data.
        Useful to work with data whose mean is significantly equal to
        zero but is not exactly zero.
        If False, the robust location and covariance are directly computed
        with the FastMCD algorithm without additional treatment.

    support_fraction : float, default=None
        The proportion of points to be included in the support of the raw
        MCD estimate. Default is None, which implies that the minimum
        value of support_fraction will be used within the algorithm:
        `(n_samples + n_features + 1) / 2 * n_samples`. The parameter must be
        in the range (0, 1].

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines the pseudo random number generator for shuffling the data.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

        The raw robust estimated covariance before correction and re-weighting.

    raw_support_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        A mask of the observations that have been used to compute
        the raw robust estimates of location and shape, before correction
        and re-weighting.

    location_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Estimated robust location.

    covariance_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated robust covariance matrix.

    (see [1]_).

    The shrinkage formulation implemented here differs from Eq. 23 in [1]_. In
    the original article, formula (23) states that 2/p (p being the number of
    features) is multiplied by Trace(cov*cov) in both the numerator and
    denominator, but this operation is omitted because for a large p, the value
    of 2/p is so small that it doesn't affect the value of the estimator.
