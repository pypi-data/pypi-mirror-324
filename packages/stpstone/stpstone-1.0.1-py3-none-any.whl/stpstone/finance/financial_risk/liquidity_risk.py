            IT MEASURES THE MARGIN OF SAFETY A COMPANY HAS FOR PAYING INTEREST ON ITS DEBT

            BY DEBT VERSUS ASSETS, AND THEREFORE, ITS ABILITY TO PAY OFF ITS DEBT WITH 
            ITS AVAILABLE ASSETS. A HIGHER RATIO, ESPECIALLY ABOVE 1.0, INDICATES THAT A COMPANY 
            IS SIGNIFICANTLY FUNDED BY DEBT AND MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY MEETINGS ITS OBLIGATIONS.

        DOCSTRING: THE D/E RATIO IS SIMILAR TO THE DEBT-TO-ASSETS RATIO, IN THAT IT INDICATES HOW 
            A COMPANY IS FUNDED, IN THIS CASE, BY DEBT. THE HIGHER THE RATIO, THE MORE DEBT 
            A COMPANY HAS ON ITS BOOKS, MEANING THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT IS HIGHER. THE RATIO 
            LOOKS AT HOW MUCH OF THE DEBT CAN BE COVERED BY EQUITY IF THE COMPANY NEEDED TO LIQUIDATE.
