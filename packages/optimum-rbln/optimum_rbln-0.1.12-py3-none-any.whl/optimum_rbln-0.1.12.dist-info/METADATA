# Optimum RBLN

ðŸ¤— Optimum RBLN is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and RBLN AcceleratorsÂ including [ATOM](https://atom_link) and [REBEL](https://rebel_link).
It provides a set of tools enabling easy model loading and inference on single- and multi-Accelerator settings for different downstream tasks.
The list of officially validated models and tasks is available [here](https://docs.rbln.ai/software/optimum/optimum_rbln.html). Users can try other models and tasks with only few changes.

## Install from PyPI

To install the latest release of this package:

- Export environment variables to access to RBLN private PyPI.
  ```bash
  export REBEL_PYPI_USERNAME=<username>
  export REBEL_PYPI_PASSWORD=<password>
  ```

- Install optimum-rbln package:
  ```bash
  pip install --index-url https://pypi.rebellions.in/simple optimum-rbln
  ```

## Install from source

### Prerequisites

- Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) (refer [this link](https://pdm-project.org/latest/#installation) for detailed commands)

The below command installs optimum-rbln along with its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebellions-sw/optimum-rbln.git
cd optimum-rbln
pdm install
```

To install optional dependencies from all groups, specify `-G:all` option.

```bash
pdm install -G:all
```

If you want to install optimum-rbln as [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) in existing venv,
```bash
(venv) pip install -e .
```

## How to use it?

### Quick Start

ðŸ¤— Optimum RBLN was designed with one goal in mind: **to make inference straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of RBLN Accelerators**.

### Documentation

Check out [the documentation of Optimum RBLN](https://docs.rbln.ai/software/optimum/optimum_rbln.html) for more advanced usage.
