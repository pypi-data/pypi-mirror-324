# Emergent Language Analysis Toolkit

This toolkit aims to collect all metrics currently used in emergent
communication research into one place. The usage should be convenient and the
inputs should be standardised, to ease adoption and spread of these metrics.

## Installation

To install emlangkit, run `pip install emlangkit`.

Automatic tests are run for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.

## Usage

All metrics are available through the `Language` class in `emlangkit.Language`.
This class accepts two numpy arrays as inputs - messages and observations. These
are then used, with some possible speedups, to calculate any requested metric,
as per example below

```python
import numpy as np
from emlangkit import Language

messages = np.array(
    [[1, 2, 0, 3, 4], [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 2, 3, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]]
)
observations = np.array([[4, 4], [4, 3], [3, 2], [1, 4]])

lang = Language(messages=messages, observations=observations)

score, p_value = lang.topsim()

# Mutual information already requires both language and observation entropy
mi = lang.mutual_information()

# So this call uses less computation
lang_entropy = lang.language_entropy()
```

## Metrics

Currently available metrics, with their implementations as per below.

- Entropy \[1,2\] (`emlangkit.metrics.entropy`)
- Mutual Information \[1,2\] (`emlangkit.metrics.mutual_information`)
- Topographic Similarity \[1,2,3\] (`emlangkit.metrics.topsim`)
- Positional Disentanglement \[2,4\] (`emlangkit.metrics.posdis`)
- Bag-of-Words Disentanglement \[2,4\] (`emlangkit.metrics.bosdis`)
- M_previous^n \[5\] (`emlangkit.metrics.mpn`)
- Harris' Articulation Scheme \[6\] (`emlangkit.metrics.has`)
- Non-Compositional Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) \[7\]
  (`emlangkit.metrics.nc_npmi`)

## Contributing

All pull requests are welcome! Just please make sure to install pre-commit and
run the pytests before submitting a PR. Additionally, if a lot of new code is
added, please also add the relevant tests.
