# This is a Docker Compose override file that allows you to customize service configurations.
# To use this file:
#
# 1. Uncomment the services you want to modify
# 2. Make your desired changes to those services
# 3. Save as 'docker-compose.override.yaml'
# 4. Run 'docker compose build' and 'docker compose up -d' as normal
#
# Note: Each service (api, postgres, etc.) can only be defined once in the override file.
# If you need multiple changes to a service, combine them under a single service definition.
