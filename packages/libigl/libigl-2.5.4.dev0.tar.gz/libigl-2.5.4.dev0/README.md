# libigl Python Bindings
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/libigl.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/libigl/)
[![buildwheels](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-python-bindings/actions/workflows/wheels.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-python-bindings/actions/workflows/wheels.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


This repository contains the source code for the libigl Python bindings. These bindings are fully compatible with NumPy and SciPy and offer a convenient interface similar to functions in those libraries.

These bindings are still under active development and should still be considered alpha quality. We encourage users to post issues so we can improve the bindings!

## Installation

```
python -m pip install libigl
```

If you wish to install the current development code, you can compile the library from scratch. Clone this repo and issue

```
python -m pip install ./
```


## [Help/Documentation](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/)

* A tutorial on how to use the bindings can be found [here](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/tutorials/)
* A function reference can be found [here](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/igl_docs/)

## Compiling and modifying the bindiings

According to the [scikit-build-core documentation](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#editable-installs), the way to make an editable (incremental) build is to:

 1. Preinstall the dependencies (at the top of pyproject.toml 
 2. Then use this very long command:

```
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable.rebuild=true -Cbuild-dir=build -ve.
```

## Testing cibuildwheel locally

Install whichever version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then run:

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/[version]/bin/python -m pip install cibuildwheel
    CIBW_BUILD="cp311-*" python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse --platform macos
