This repository is powered by the [Collective Mind workflow automation framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm).

Two key automations developed using CM are **Script** and **Cache**, which streamline machine learning (ML) workflows, 
including managing Docker runs. Both Script and Cache automations are part of the **cmx4mlops** repository.

The [CM scripts](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts), 
also housed in this repository, consist of hundreds of modular Python-wrapped scripts accompanied 
by `yaml` metadata, enabling the creation of robust and flexible ML workflows.
