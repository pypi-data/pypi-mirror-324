| matplotlib | >=3.3.2     | for static plotting and visualizations               |
| torch      | >=1.7.1     | Only necessary if you want to use Neural NARX models |


| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Windows  | ok     |
| Linux    | ok     |
| Mac OS   | ok     |

SysIdentPy **do not** to support Python 2.7.

A few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0. However, it is not required to use SysIdentPy.

## Installation

### with pip <small>recommended</small> { #with-pip data-toc-label="with pip" }

SysIdentPy is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. If not, scroll down and expand
the help box. Install with:

=== "Latest"

    ``` sh
    pip install sysidentpy
    ```

=== "Neural NARX Support"

    ``` sh
    pip install sysidentpy["all"]
    ```

=== "v0.1.6"

    ``` sh
    pip install sysidentpy=="0.1.6"
    ```

??? question "How to manage my projects dependencies?"

    If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading [Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies], which is a really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors.

### with git

SysIdentPy can be used directly from [GitHub] by cloning the
repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you
want to use the very latest version:

```
git clone https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy.git
```
