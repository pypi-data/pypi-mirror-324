# Datoma
[Datoma](https://datoma.cloud/) is a cloud computing web service solution that offers experimental scientists a fast and easy way to analyze mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data for free, while giving code developers the opportunity to increase visibility and usability of their code.
This Python module enables users to use the platform programmatically: upload files, launch new jobs and create custom metabolomics workflows from existing tools. Check out the documentation [here](https://datoma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).
