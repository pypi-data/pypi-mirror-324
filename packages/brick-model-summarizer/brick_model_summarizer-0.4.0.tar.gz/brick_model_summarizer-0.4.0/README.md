# BRICK Model Summarizer

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/brick-model-summarizer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/brick-model-summarizer/)
[![Tests](https://github.com/bbartling/BrickModelSummarizer/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bbartling/BrickModelSummarizer/actions)


**BRICK Model Summarizer** is a Python tool designed to validate and benchmark AI-generated BRICK models against reference models. It transforms complex BRICK schema TTL files into concise, human-readable summaries of HVAC systems, zones, meters, and central plants. By leveraging [reference BRICK models](https://brickschema.org/resources/#reference-brick-models), this tool enables users to validate AI-created models for consistency, accuracy, and adherence to expected standards.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a framework for summarizing BRICK models into HVAC-centric insights. This is especially useful for:
- **Benchmarking AI-generated BRICK models** against reference models.
- **Validating BRICK schemas** for completeness and alignment with building system expectations.
- **Empowering building engineers, analysts, and AI developers** with clear summaries of mechanical systems and operational data.

## Key Features

- **HVAC-Focused Summarization**: Extracts key details about AHUs, VAVs, meters, and central plant equipment.
- **Model Validation**: Provides a framework for benchmarking AI-created BRICK models.
- **Scalable Processing**: Processes individual or multiple BRICK schema TTL files.


## Installation
```bash
pip install brick-model-summarizer

## Usage

The package includes functions for summarizing BRICK models and generating detailed outputs. Below is an example of how to use the tool in Python to generate JSON-style data.


### Example: Processing a BRICK Model

```python
from brick_model_summarizer.utils import load_graph
from brick_model_summarizer.ahu_info import identify_ahu_equipment, collect_ahu_data
from brick_model_summarizer.zone_info import identify_zone_equipment, collect_zone_data
from brick_model_summarizer.meters_info import query_meters, collect_meter_data
from brick_model_summarizer.central_plant_info import (
    identify_hvac_system_equipment,
    collect_central_plant_data,
)
from brick_model_summarizer.building_info import collect_building_data
from brick_model_summarizer.class_tag_checker import analyze_classes_and_tags
import json

# Path to the BRICK schema TTL file
brick_model_file = "sample_brick_models/bldg6.ttl"

# Load the RDF graph once
graph = load_graph(brick_model_file)

# Extract structured data using modular functions
ahu_data = collect_ahu_data(identify_ahu_equipment(graph))
zone_info = identify_zone_equipment(graph)
zone_data = collect_zone_data(zone_info)
building_data = collect_building_data(graph)
meter_data = collect_meter_data(query_meters(graph))
central_plant_data = collect_central_plant_data(identify_hvac_system_equipment(graph))
class_tag_summary = analyze_classes_and_tags(graph)
vav_boxes_per_ahu = zone_info.get("vav_per_ahu", {})

# Construct the final structured output
building_data_summary = {
    "ahu_information": ahu_data,
    "zone_information": zone_data,
    "building_information": building_data,
    "meter_information": meter_data,
    "central_plant_information": central_plant_data,
    "number_of_vav_boxes_per_ahu": vav_boxes_per_ahu,
    "class_tag_summary": class_tag_summary,
}

# Print the output in JSON format
print(json.dumps(building_data_summary, indent=2))

# Optionally, save the output as a JSON file
output_file = "bldg6_summary.json"
with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    json.dump(building_data_summary, file, indent=2)

```

### Validating AI-Generated Models
Use the outputs to compare AI-created models against reference BRICK models, checking for consistency in:
- Equipment classification (e.g., AHUs, VAVs).
- Sensor and control points.
- Central plant configurations.

## Sample Data

Reference BRICK models from [BRICK resources](https://brickschema.org/resources/#reference-brick-models) are included in the `sample_brick_models` directory. These files can be used for testing and validation.

## Web App Demo

* https://bensapi.pythonanywhere.com/
* Upload and process `.ttl` files to generate detailed BRICK model summaries.
* Compare your AI-generated models with [official BRICK Reference Models](https://brickschema.org/resources/#reference-brick-models).
* Easy-to-use web interface with support for `.ttl` file validation.
