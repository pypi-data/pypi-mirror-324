    Do the following step by step:
    1. Think about the leads the user wants to query and filters to use for the same. 
    2. If the user has provided a sales navigator url use that.
    3. Take a look at the examples provided to construct the URL if user has not provided one. 
    4. Think about the code example provided and see how you will fill the english_request_for_salesnav_search and user_input_salesnav_url correctly.
    5. Generate the correct python code which takes care of above requirements. 
    6. Make sure the code is valid and returns results in the format ("SUCCESS", leads_list) or ("ERROR", []).
    7. Return the result in valid JSON format filled in workflow_python_code.
    
    The user wants to generate code in python that performs the following:

    "{english_description}"

    Example of a workflow python code:
    {example_of_workflow_code}
    
    If user has provided a Sales Navigator URL set to to user_input_salesnav_url in the code and pass as input to generate_salesnav_people_search_url.

    Each lead returned has at least:
    full_name, first_name, last_name, email, lead_salesnav_url, company_salesnav_url,
    user_linkedin_url, primary_domain_of_organization, job_title, phone, headline,
    lead_location, organization_name, organization_website, summary_about_lead, keywords,
