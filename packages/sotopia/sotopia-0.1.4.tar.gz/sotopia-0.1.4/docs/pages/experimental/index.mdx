This part of the documentation is for experimental features. The APIs and functionalities are subject to frequent change.
</Callout>

The experimental APIs of Sotopia are intended for quickly prototyping and experimenting with new functionalities,
without breaking the existing stable APIs. But we will still maintain the quality of the code for these features.
Feel free to raise an issue if you find any bugs or wants more features in the experimental APIs.

# Experimetal APIs
The experimental APIs are in different states:

- *scheduled*: the APIs will be merged into next minor releases.
- *implemented*: the APIs are implemented and can be used, which might be merged into the stable APIs in the next few minor releases.
- *planned*: the APIs are planned and will be implemented in the future.
- *idealized*: the APIs are idealized and might be implemented in the future.

Here are the experimental APIs:
- [Agents](/experimental/agents) (*implemented*): aact-based asynchronous agents that don't follow OpenAI Gym's turn-based formulation.
- Engines (*planned*): aact-based asynchronous environment engines. This would include
    - [Orchestrator](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/issues/231): an engine base class for engines that dictates the orders and turns of the agents.
    - [Evaluator](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/issues/232): an engine base class for engines that evaluates the agents' performance.
    - API Engine: an engine that interacts with REST APIs.
- Generation APIs (*planned*): experimental generation APIs
