pycraf - Jupyter Notebooks
******

This folder contains example tutorial-style worksheets (as
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ Notebooks). Note that GitHub cannot render
all features properly, when viewing in the browser. It is possible to
use the `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org>`_ web service alternatively.
One only needs to provide a link to the raw notebook file on GitHub
(click on the "Raw" button in the GitHub interface.)
