# ReCAPTCHASolver: Automate reCAPTCHA Audio Challenges with Python  

ReCAPTCHASolver is a Python package that automates the process of solving Google's reCAPTCHA using audio challenges. It utilizes Selenium for web automation, requests for downloading audio files, and Google Speech Recognition for transcription.  

## Features  
- Automates solving of Google reCAPTCHA challenges
- Uses speech-to-text to decode audio challenges
- Handles reCAPTCHA v2 (audio challenges)
- Verifies the installation of FFmpeg and configures it automatically
- Works with Selenium and requires the driver with the reCAPTCHA iframe to be provided
