## Features

- **Real-time System Monitoring**
  - CPU usage per core with frequency tracking
  - Memory utilization
  - Disk I/O with read/write speeds
  - Network traffic monitoring
  - GPU metrics (if NVIDIA GPU is available)

- **Responsive Design**
  - Automatically adjusts layout based on terminal size
  - Supports horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts
  - Dynamic resizing with smooth transitions

- **Process Management**
  - View top-level user processes
  - Monitor system resource usage per process

## Installation

You can install Ground Control directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ground-control-tui
```

or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alberto-rota/ground-control
cd ground-control
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

After installation, simply run:

```bash
groundcontrol
```

Or use it as a Python module:

```bash
python -m ground_control
```

## Usage

### Keyboard Controls

- `h`: Switch to horizontal layout
- `v`: Switch to vertical layout
- `g`: Switch to grid layout
- `a`: Toggle automatic layout
- `q`: Quit the application

### Layout Modes

Ground Control offers three layout modes:

1. **Grid Layout (Default)**: 2x2 grid arrangement
2. **Horizontal Layout**: All panels in a row
3. **Vertical Layout**: All panels in a column

The layout automatically adjusts based on your terminal size, but you can override this using the keyboard controls.

### Process Monitoring

To view top-level processes for the current user:

```bash
python -m ground_control.cli.process_list
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- psutil
- textual
- plotext
- pynvml (optional, for NVIDIA GPU monitoring)
