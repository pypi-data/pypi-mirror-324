## Overwriting the used package for relative imports

Provide the `package` parameter to Monkay. By default it is set to the `__spec__.parent` of the module.
For a toplevel module it is the same name like the module.

## Adding dynamically lazy imports

For adding lazy imports there are two methods:

- `add_lazy_import(export_name, path_or_fn, *, no_hooks=False)`: Adding new lazy import or fail if already exist.
- `add_deprecated_lazy_import(export_name, DeprecatedImport, *, no_hoosk=False)`: Adding new deprecated lazy import or fail if already exist.

By default the `__all__` variable is not modified but sometimes this is desirable.

For this cases hooks exist:

- `pre_add_lazy_import_hook(key, value, type_: Literal["lazy_import" | "deprecated_lazy_import"])`: Wrap around key and value and takes as third parameter the type.
- `post_add_lazy_import_hook(key)`: The way to go to update the `__all__` variable dynamically.

The hooks are only executed when manually adding a lazy import and not during the setup of Monkay.

### Example: Automatically update `__all__`

``` python

from monkay import Monkay

# we use a set
__all__ = {"bar"}

monkay = Monkay(
    # required for autohooking
    globals(),
    lazy_imports={
        "bar": "tests.targets.fn_module:bar",
    },
    settings_path="settings_path:Settings",
    post_add_lazy_import_hook=__all__.add
)

if monkay.settings.with_deprecated:
    monkay.add_deprecated_lazy_import(
        "deprecated",
        {
            "path": "tests.targets.fn_module:deprecated",
            "reason": "old.",
            "new_attribute": "super_new",
        }
    )
    # __all__ has now also deprecated when with_deprecated is true
```

### Example: prefix lazy imports

``` python

from monkay import Monkay

# we use a set
__all__ = {"bar"}

def prefix_fn(name: str, value: Any, type_: str) -> tuple[str, Any]:
    return f"{type_}_prefix_{name}", value

monkay = Monkay(
    # required for autohooking
    globals(),
    lazy_imports={
        "bar": "tests.targets.fn_module:bar",
    },
    pre_add_lazy_import_hook=prefix_fn,
    post_add_lazy_import_hook=__all__.add
)
monkay.add_deprecated_lazy_import(
    "deprecated",
    {
        "path": "tests.targets.fn_module:deprecated",
        "reason": "old.",
        "new_attribute": "super_new",
    }
)
# __all__, lazy_imports has now also deprecated under a type prefix name
# but we can skip the hooks with no_hooks=True

monkay.add_deprecated_lazy_import(
    "deprecated",
    {
        "path": "tests.targets.fn_module:deprecated",
        "reason": "old.",
        "new_attribute": "super_new",
    },
    no_hooks=True
)
```

## Manual extension setup

Extensions can be added via the add_extension method.
It has 2 keyword parameters:

- use_overwrite (by default True): Use the temporary overwrite provided by with_extensions. Setting this to False is a shortcut to unapply via with_extensions.
- on_conflict (by default "error"): Define what happens on a name conflict: error, keep (old extension), replace (with provided extension)


## Temporary disable overwrite

You can also use the `with_...` functions with None. This disables the overwrite for the scope.
It is used in set_instance when applying extensions.

## Echoed values

The `with_` and `set_` methods return the passed variable as contextmanager value.

e.g.

``` python

with monkay.with_settings(Settings()) as new_settings:
    # do things with the settings overwrite

    # disable the overwrite
    with monkay.with_settings(None) as new_settings2:
        # echoed is None
        assert new_settings2 is None
        # settings are the old settings again
        assert monkay.settings is old_settings
```

## `evaluate_preloads`

`evaluate_preloads` is a way to load preloads everywhere in the application. It returns True if all preloads succeeded.
This is useful together with `ignore_import_errors=True`.

### Parameters

- `preloads` (also positional): import strings to import. See [Preloads](./tutorial.md#preloads) for the special syntax.
- `ignore_import_errors`: Ignore import errors of preloads. When `True` (default) not all import
  strings must be available. When `False` all must be available.
- `package` (Optional). Provide a different package as parent package. By default (when empty) the package of the Monkay instance is used.

Note: `monkay.base` contains a slightly different `evaluate_preloads` which uses when no package is provided the `None` package. It doesn't require
an Monkay instance either.

## Typings

Monkay is fully typed and its main class Monkay is a Generic supporting 2 type parameters:

`INSTANCE` and `SETTINGS`.

Monkay features also a protocol type for extensions: `ExtensionProtocol`.
This is protocol is runtime checkable and has also support for both paramers.

Here a combined example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from monkay import Monkay, ExtensionProtocol

class Instance: ...


# providing Instance and Settings as generic types is entirely optional here
@dataclass
class Extension(ExtensionProtocol["Instance", "Settings"]):
    name: str = "hello"

    def apply(self, monkay_instance: Monkay) -> None:
        """Do something here"""


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    extensions: list[ExtensionProtocol["Instance", "Settings"]] =[Extension()]


# type Monkay more strict
monkay = Monkay[Instance, Settings](
    globals(),
    # provide settings object via class
    settings_path=Settings,
    with_extensions=True,
    settings_extensions_name="extensions"
)
```

## Cages

Cages are very special. They are an extracted logic of the Monkay object for global
mutated structures, which are not async (threading & userland-threads (e.g. asyncio)) safe.
Cages make them async safe and also provides a way to have simple global structures which are async
safe from the start.

It is far more than *just* a simple special feature of Monkay so it has it's own documentation
