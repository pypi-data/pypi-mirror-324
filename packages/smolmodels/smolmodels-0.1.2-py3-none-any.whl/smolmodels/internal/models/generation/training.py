    generate_training_tests: Generates tests for the machine learning model training code.
    fix_training_code: Fixes the machine learning model training code based on review and identified problems.
    fix_training_tests: Fixes the tests for the machine learning model training code based on review and identified problems.
    review_training_code: Reviews the machine learning model training code to identify improvements and fix issues.
    review_training_tests: Reviews the tests for the machine learning model training code to identify improvements and fix issues.

Classes:
    TrainingCodeGenerator: A class to generate, fix, and review machine learning model training code.
