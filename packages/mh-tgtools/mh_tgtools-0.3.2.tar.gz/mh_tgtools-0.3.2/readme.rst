Tools for Siklu by Ceragon TG Radios
=======================================

**TgTools** is a collection of tools to help manage large networks with multiple
Siklu by Ceragon MultiHaul TG radios. 

**Note: Program still under development and more tools are being actively added.**
   
Currently Available Tools
---------------------------

 * **TgCrawl** crawls the network discovering TG radios, collecting, parsing information, and saving to csv files:
  
   - telemetry
   - events
   - configuration
   
   TgCrawler can run a single time, or repeatedly (polling mode).
   
**TgTools** is currently released as a command-line script / executable.
It is an improved version of `Batchscanner <https://batchscanner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_,
but focuses exclusively on MultiHaul TG radios.
