"""
typer is currently a big compromise, missing features (as of v0.9:
- dict, unions as input type
- get help-text for arguments / options from docstring in fn()
- move initial argument-processing to pydantic model (and use it in typer)
    - https://pypi.org/project/clidantic/
    - would allow loading parameters from file (json, yaml), also storing it
