# FastAPI Wallet Authentication

fastapi-walletauth provides a simple way to authenticate users in FastAPI applications using a wallet.
It currently supports Ethereum and Solana wallets/signatures.

## Installation

```shell
pip install fastapi-walletauth
```

## Usage

Adding the authentication endpoints is as simple as importing the `authorization_routes` from `fastapi_walletauth`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_walletauth import jwt_authorization_router

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(jwt_authorization_router)
```

This will add the following endpoints to your application:

- `POST /authentication/challenge`: Returns a challenge for the user to sign
- `POST /authentication/solve`: Returns a Bearer token if the signature is valid
- `POST /authentication/logout`: Invalidates the current token
- `POST /authentication/refresh`: Returns a new token if the current token is valid

You can then use `WalletAuthDep` to protect your endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_walletauth import JWTWalletAuthDep, jwt_authorization_router

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(jwt_authorization_router)

@app.get("/protected")
def protected(wa: JWTWalletAuthDep):
    return wa.address
```

## Signing the challenge

The challenge message is now formatted in a human-readable way and includes the following fields:

```
Hello, please sign this message!
Chain: ETH
Address: 0x...
App: myapp
Time: 2025-01-29 15:22:39
```

**PLEASE NOTE**: The `app` field needs to be set to the name of your application. This is used to prevent replay attacks.
```shell
export FASTAPI_WALLETAUTH_APP=myapp
```

The signature format depends on the wallet type and is specified in the `chain` field. This signature is then sent to the `/authentication/solve` endpoint to obtain a Bearer token.


## Custom Greeting Configuration

Starting from version 2.1.0, `fastapi-walletauth` allows you to configure a custom greeting message that will be included in the challenge message. This greeting can be set in the server configuration and will be used for all challenge messages.

### Setting the Greeting

The greeting message can be configured in the `Settings` class within your application. By default, the greeting is set to "Hello, please sign this message!". You can change this by setting the `GREETING` environment variable or by modifying the `Settings` class directly.

Example:

```python
from fastapi_walletauth.common import settings

# Set a custom greeting
settings.GREETING = "Welcome! Please sign this message to continue."
```
