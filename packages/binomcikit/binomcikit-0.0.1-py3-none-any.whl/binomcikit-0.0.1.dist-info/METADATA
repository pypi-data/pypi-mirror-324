# proportion
Python package for proportion

Multiple procedures to obtain an interval estimate for an unknown 
proportion (p) based on binomial sampling. It is known that approximations
are poor when the true p is close to zero or to one. So we provide alternative
procedures with better properties. Non-iterative methods widely discussed
in literature for computing a (central) two-sided interval estimate for p are
implemented in terms of coverage probability and expected length.
