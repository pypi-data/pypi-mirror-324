# DeepSomaticCopy

The pip package "DeepSomaticCopy" implements our "DeepCopy" algorithm for single cell copy number calling.
DeepCopy specifically works on single cell DNA sequencing data of tumors, and reconstructs copy number profiles using an evolution-aware deep reinforcement learning algorithm. 
Additional informaiton is provided on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/elkebir-group/DeepCopy).
