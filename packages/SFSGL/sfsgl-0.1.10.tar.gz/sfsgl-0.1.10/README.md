# **SFSGL (Simple File Sharing Gathering Library)**

### Description
This is a simple file-sharing and gathering library. It provides a simple interface to share and gather files. The library is implemented using Flask and Flask-RESTful. The library provides two interfaces, one for sharing files and the other for gathering files. The library is implemented in a way that it can be used as a standalone application. This library's main purpose is to apply programming course assignments and quizzes safely and securely (without using ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.). For example, in your lab, if you have an intranet you can share your programming assignments with your students and gather their solutions without using any other tools. They only reach your server and they can't connect outside of the lab network.

### Installation
You can install the library using pip.

```bash
pip install sfsgl
```

### Docker installation and running
You can run this docker command to build and run the application using the docker container.
```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
docker run -p 5001:5001 -p 5002:5002 my-python-app
```



### Usage
You can use the library as a standalone application. You can run the following command to start the application.

```bash
python -m sfsgl
```

### Example Usage
```python 
    from SFSGL.sfsgl import SFSGL

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        session = SFSGL(shared_folder_path= "exact_path_to_shared_folder")
        session.start()
```

!!! You'll need to specify the the exact path of the shared folder otherwise the library cannot find your folder path.
