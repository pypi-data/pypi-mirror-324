# Create a new instance of the NGOHub class
hub = NGOHub(api_base_url="https://api.ngohub.ro")

else:
    print("The API is not healthy")
```

## Development

### Local development

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment using python 3.12 or higher and activate it
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    ```

And you're ready to go.

### Running the tests

To run the tests, we use tox, to check for different environments and run multiple checks and configurations.

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
tox
```

### Updating the requirements

To update the requirements, you can run the following command:

```bash
tox -e update-requirements
```

### Creating a new release

1. Update the version in the `pyproject.toml` file
2. Create a new tag with the version and push it
3. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the new changes

The GitHub Actions will take care of the rest.
