LCOM1:
Graph where nodes are methods. Undirected edge iff the two methods share at least one attribute.

LCOM2:
Same graph as LCOM1.

LCOM3:
Same graph as LCOM1.

LCOM4:
Like the graph in LCOM1, but also includes an edge if m1 directly calls m2 or vice versa.

Co:
Same graph as LCOM4.

TCC:
Graph where nodes are *public* methods, excluding constructors. Undirected edge if the two methods directly or indirectly use a common attribute.

LCC:
Transitive closure of the graph in TCC.
