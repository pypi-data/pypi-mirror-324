    """Create a sorting key for a DICOM file

    Calculate the projection of the image position patient along the
    axis perpendicular to the images themselves, i.e. along the stack
    axis. Intended use is for the sorting key to sort a stack of image
    datasets so that they are in order, regardless of whether the images
    are axial, coronal, or sagittal, and independent from the order in
    which the images were read in.
