Fast linear interpolation for 1D, 2D, and 3D data.

This module provides functions for efficient linear interpolation of 1D, 2D, and 3D
data using NumPy and Numba. It includes both a high-level interface (:func:`interp`) and
lower-level functions for specific dimensionalities.

Key Features:
    - Fast linear interpolation for 1D, 2D, and 3D data
    - Support for both grid-based and point-based interpolation
    - Numba-accelerated core interpolation functions
    - Input validation and error checking
    - Visualization tool for comparing original and interpolated data

Main Functions:
    - :func:`interp`: High-level interface for linear interpolation
    - :func:`interp_linear_1d`, :func:`interp_linear_2d`, :func:`interp_linear_3d`: Dimension-specific interpolation
    - :func:`plot_interp_comparison_heatmap`: Visualize original vs interpolated data

Dependencies:
    - NumPy
    - Numba
    - Matplotlib
    - SciPy (for comparison function)

Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pymedphys.interpolate import interp
    >>>
    >>> # Define known data
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 11)
    >>> y = np.linspace(0, 10, 11)
    >>> z = np.linspace(0, 10, 11)
    >>> values = np.random.rand(11, 11, 11)
    >>>
    >>> # Define interpolation points
    >>> x_interp = np.linspace(0, 10, 21)
    >>> y_interp = np.linspace(0, 10, 21)
    >>> z_interp = np.linspace(0, 10, 21)
    >>>
    >>> # Perform interpolation
    >>> interpolated_values = interp(
    ...     [x, y, z], values, axes_interp=[x_interp, y_interp, z_interp]
    ... )
