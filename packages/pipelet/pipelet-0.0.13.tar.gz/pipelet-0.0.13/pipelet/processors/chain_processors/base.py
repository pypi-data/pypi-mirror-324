Processor Classes for ETL Chain Operations

This module contains two key processor classes used in the ETL chain-of-responsibility pattern:
`ChainAnyProcessor` and `ChainAllProcessor`.

1. **ChainAnyProcessor**:
   - A processor that processes data through a chain of sub-processors, attempting each in order.
   - The first sub-processor that successfully processes the data is moved to the front of the chain, ensuring it is prioritized in future attempts.
   - If no processor in the chain can handle the data, an error is logged.

2. **ChainAllProcessor**:
   - A processor that executes multiple sub-processors in parallel, either using threads or processes.
   - Results from sub-processors are yielded as soon as they become available.
   - If any exception occurs during processing, it is logged.

Classes:
- `ChainAnyProcessor`: A processor that attempts to process data through each sub-processor in sequence.
- `ChainAllProcessor`: A processor that executes all sub-processors in parallel.

Both processors are designed to be part of a larger ETL pipeline, facilitating flexible data processing strategies.

    A processor that processes data through a chain of sub-processors.

    The processor attempts to process the input data using each of the 
    sub-processors in the order they appear. The first processor that successfully
    handles the data will pass the result to the next processor in the chain (if 
    any). If no processor is able to process the data, an error is logged. 
    Processors that successfully handle the data are moved to the front of the chain.

    Attributes:
        _last_success_processor (Optional[Type[BaseProcessor]]): The processor 
        that last successfully handled the data.
        _sub_processors (List[BaseProcessor]): A list of sub-processors to attempt processing.

        processor (if there is one). If no processor can handle the data, an error
        is logged. If the data is processed successfully, the result is yielded.
