# GridSearchHelper

GridSearchHelper is a Python library designed to simplify hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search. It allows for automatic parameter grid generation and performs efficient grid search for machine learning models. 

## Installation

You can install GridSearchHelper from PyPI:

```bash
pip install GridSearchHelper

# Hyperparameter Tuning for Classifiers

This project implements a hyperparameter tuning utility for multiple classifiers using `GridSearchCV` from `sklearn`. The supported classifiers include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, MLP, and more.

## Features
- Grid search for hyperparameter optimization on a variety of models.
- Support for additional custom parameters.
- Cross-validation (CV) support for model evaluation.
- Parallel processing for faster results.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ``bash
   git clone https://github.com/alimovabdulla/GridSearchHelper.git
