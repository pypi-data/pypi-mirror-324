           (i) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
           Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
           display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
           either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work;

       apply to the combination of the Contributions with the Covered Software if,
       and only if, such combination is considered a “Modified Version” under
       Section 3.3.

   2.2. Effective Date of Patent License

       The patent license granted in Section 2.1(A)(ii) begins on the date You
       obtain, or later, a copy of the Covered Software.

   2.3. Redistribution

       You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Covered Software or Modified
       Versions thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source
       Code Form or Executable Form, provided that You meet all of the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Covered Software or
             Modified Versions a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
             that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source Code Form of any Derivative Works that
             You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
             notices from the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, excluding those
             notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Covered Software includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
             a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
             file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
             Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
             text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
             Code Form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
             or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
             third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
             informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your
             own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Covered Software, provided that
             such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
             License.

   2.4. Distribution of Executable Form

       You may distribute the Covered Software in Executable Form under the terms of
       this License, provided that You also do one or both of the following:

         (a) either accompany the Executable Form with the Source Code Form of the
         Covered Software, or

         (b) accompany the Executable Form with a written offer, valid for at least
         three years, to give anyone who possesses the Executable Form a copy of the
         Source Code Form of the Covered Software.

       You may distribute the Source Code Form of the Covered Software under the terms
       of this License in any medium or format; provided that if You distribute the
       Covered Software in a form other than a physical product, You must also make
       the Source Code Form available by prominently posting the license text in a
       location associated with the covered work.

   2.5. Representation of Authority to Contribute

       If You distribute Covered Software that contains a Contribution, You
       represent that Your Contribution is Your original creation (and/or You have
       sufficient rights to grant the rights in the Contribution) and that You have
       the right to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

   2.6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
       without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
       including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of
       defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
       The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is
       with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
       (not the initial Contributor or any other Contributor) assume the cost of any
       necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty
       constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
       authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

   2.7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort,
       contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor be liable to You for any indirect,
       special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of the use of the Covered Software including, without limitation,
       damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
       or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such Contributor has
       been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   2.8. Termination

       This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
       if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within
       30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses shall survive the
       termination of this License. Sections 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 will survive
       any termination of this License.

   3. Responsibilities

   3.1. Availability of Source Code

       If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then You must either:
       (a) include the Source Code Form in the distribution, or
       (b) explicitly state in or with the distribution that the Source Code Form is
       available via an electronic link, and ensure that the Source Code Form remains
       available for as long as necessary to satisfy the terms of this License.

   3.2. Updates for Security Purposes

       Although this License does not require Contributors to update their
       Contributions or the Covered Software, each Contributor is encouraged to
       provide such updates in order to maximize the security and utility of the
       Covered Software.

   3.3. Modified Versions

       You may create a Modified Version of the Covered Software, provided that you
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) The Modified Version must, at a minimum, be marked or otherwise
           identified as a Modified Version, so as not to confuse it with the
           Original Covered Software; and

       (b) The Modified Version does not alter or remove any of the copyright,
           patent, trademark, or attribution notices contained in the Covered
           Software.

       Notwithstanding the above, if a Modified Version combines portions of the
       Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, then
       the terms of those Secondary Licenses shall apply to the combination as a
       whole, and not individually to the Covered Software.

   3.4. Responsibility for Compliance

       You are responsible for ensuring that any use, reproduction, or distribution of
       the Covered Software complies with the terms of this License.

   3.5. Representations and Warranties

       The initial Contributor expressly disclaims any warranty or representation,
       either express or implied, with respect to the Covered Software, including,
       without limitation, any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
       purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered
       Software is with You.

   3.6. Future License Versions

       Mozilla Foundation is not obligated to publish new versions of the License. However,
       each new version will be given a distinguishing version number. If the Covered
       Software specifies that a particular version of the License “or any later version”
       may be used, You may use the terms and conditions of either that specified version
       or any later version published by Mozilla Foundation. If the Covered Software
       does not specify a version number of this License, then the version currently
       published on the Mozilla website (http://mozilla.org/MPL/) applies.

   4. Miscellaneous

   4.1. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

   4.2. Each Contributor agrees that any legal action brought by it will be brought
   only in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the jurisdiction in which the
   Contributor resides or otherwise routinely conducts its business, and each
   Contributor irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

   4.3. This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
   initial Contributor resides, without reference to its conflicts of law principles.

   4.4. Any disputes arising out of or relating to this License shall be resolved in
   accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this License.
