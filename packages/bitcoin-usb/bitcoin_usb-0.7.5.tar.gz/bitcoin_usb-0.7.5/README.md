# Wrapper around hwi, such that one can sign bdk PSBTs directly

* This provides an abstraction layer ontop of hwi, such that only bdk is needed from the outside
* Currently supported are
  - Coldcard, Q
  - Bitbox02
  - Blockstream Jade
  - Trezor Safe 


* It also provides 
  - AddressTypes, which are the commonly used bitcoin output descriptor templates
  - seed_tools.derive_spk_provider  to derive xpubs from seeds for all AddressTypes  (bdk does not support multisig templates currently https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/1020)
  - SoftwareSigner which can sign single and multisig PSBTs, this doesn't do any security checks, so only use it on testnet
  - HWIQuick to list the connected devices without the need to unlock them
