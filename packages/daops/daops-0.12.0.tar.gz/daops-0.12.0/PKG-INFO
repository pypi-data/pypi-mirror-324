The ``daops`` library (pronounced "day-ops") provides a python interface to a
set of operations suitable for working with climate simulation outputs. It is
typically used with ESGF data sets that are described in NetCDF files. ``daops``
is unique in that it accesses a store of *fixes* defined for datasets that are
irregular when compared with others in their *population*.

When a ``daops`` operation, such as ``subset``\ , is requested, the library will look
up a database of known fixes before performing and calculations or transformations.
The data will be loaded and *fixed* using the `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`_
library before the any actual operations are sent to its sister library
`clisops <https://github.com/roocs/clisops>`_.


* Free software: BSD
* Documentation: https://daops.readthedocs.io

Features
--------

The package has the following features:


* Ability to run *data-reduction* operations on large climate data sets.
* Knowledge of irregularities/anomalies in some climate data sets.
* Ability to apply *fixes* to those data sets before operating on them.
  This process is called *normalisation* of the data sets.
