# **DualKey - Encryption/Decryption Tool**

![DualKey](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

**DualKey** is a simple command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting sensitive text using a user-defined encryption key and offset.

---

## **Features**

- ‚úÖ Encrypts text using a custom encryption key and offset  
- ‚úÖ Decrypts encrypted text back to its original form  
- ‚úÖ Simple command-line interface with input validation  
- ‚úÖ ANSI color formatting for better readability  
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)  

---

## **Installation**

### **Using Python (Recommended)**

Ensure you have **Python 3.11+** installed, then install the tool using `pip`:

```bash
pip install dualkey
```

Using Homebrew

```bash
brew install dualkey
```

## Usage

1. Running the tool
After installation, run the following command:

```bash
dualkey
```

You will be prompted to enter an encryption key and offset.

### 1. Encryption Example
```bash
Enter encryption key (4-digit number): 1234
Enter offset value (4 to 6 digit number): 56789
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? e
Enter text to encrypt (max 300 characters): hello world
```
Output:
```bash
Encrypted Text: 71547 67845 76483 76483 80185 -17301 90057 80185 83887 76483 66611
```

### 2. Decryption Example
```bash
Enter encryption key (4-digit number): 1234
Enter offset value (4 to 6 digit number): 56789
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? d
Enter the encrypted text to decrypt: 71547 67845 76483 76483 80185 -17301 90057 
```
Output:
```bash
Decrypted Text: hello world
```

### 3. How It Works
The tool uses a simple formula to encrypt each character of the input:
```sql
Encrypted character = (ASCII value * key) - offset
```

To decrypt, it reverses the formula:
```java
Original ASCII = (Encrypted value + offset) // key
```

## Example Use Cases

- Higher security when sending or storing sensitive content digitally
- Encrypting personal notes
- Quick encryption for sensitive data on the go
- Security Notice
  
**‚ö† This tool does not provide cryptographic security.**
It is a simple educational utility and should not be used for high-security applications. Always rely on industry-standard encryption methods for sensitive data.
