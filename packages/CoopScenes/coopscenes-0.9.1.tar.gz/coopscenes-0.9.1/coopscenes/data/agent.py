"""
This module defines classes representing vehicles and sensor towers, grouping various
sensor types such as cameras and lidars into cohesive structures. These classes facilitate
the management, serialization, and deserialization of sensor data for autonomous vehicles
and sensor towers.

Classes:
    VisionSensorsVeh: Groups vision (camera) sensors mounted on a vehicle.
    LaserSensorsVeh: Groups laser (lidar) sensors mounted on a vehicle.
    VisionSensorsTow: Groups vision (camera) sensors mounted on a sensor tower.
    LaserSensorsTow: Groups laser (lidar) sensors mounted on a sensor tower.
    Tower: Represents a sensor tower with grouped sensors and relevant information.
    Vehicle: Represents a vehicle with grouped sensors and relevant information.

Each class provides methods to serialize and deserialize the sensor data, enabling the
transfer and storage of complex sensor setups in a compact binary format.
