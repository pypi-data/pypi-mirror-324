  abstract = {We present flatspin, a novel simulator for systems of interacting mesoscopic spins on a lattice, also known as artificial spin ice (ASI). A generalization of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model is introduced, and combined with a well-defined switching protocol to capture realistic ASI dynamics using a point-dipole approximation. Temperature is modelled as an effective thermal field, based on the Arrhenius-N\'eel equation. Through GPU acceleration, flatspin can simulate the dynamics of millions of magnets within practical time frames, enabling exploration of large-scale emergent phenomena at unprecedented speeds. We demonstrate flatspin's versatility through the reproduction of a diverse set of established experimental results from literature. In particular, the field-driven magnetization reversal of ``pinwheel'' ASI is reproduced, for the first time, in a dipole model. Finally, we use flatspin to explore aspects of ``square'' ASI by introducing dilution defects and measuring the effect on the vertex population.},

    abstract = {Artificial spin ice is a class of lithographically created arrays of interacting ferromagnetic nanometre-scale islands. It was introduced to investigate many-body phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a material that could be tailored to precise specifications and imaged directly. Because of the large magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale islands, it has so far been impossible to thermally anneal artificial spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles; nearly all studies of artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular material activated by alternating fields or focused on the as-grown state of the arrays. This limitation has prevented experimental investigation of novel phases that can emerge from the nominal ground states of frustrated lattices. For example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which the islands are arranged on the edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted to support states with monopolar charge order at entropies below that of the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold. Here we demonstrate a method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square and kagome lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves unprecedented thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin ice, we observe incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges embedded in pseudo-ice, with crystallites of magnetic charges whose size can be controlled by tuning the lattice constant. We find excellent agreement between experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations of emergent charge-charge interactions.},

    abstract = {We have performed a detailed study on thermal annealing of the moment configuration in artificial spin ice. Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) artificial spin ice samples were examined in the prototypical square ice geometry, studying annealing as a function of island thickness, island shape, and annealing temperature and duration. We also measured the Curie temperature as a function of film thickness, finding that thickness has a strong effect on the Curie temperature in regimes of relevance to many studies of the dynamics of artificial spin ice systems. Increasing the interaction energy between island moments and reducing the energy barrier to flipping the island moments allow the system to more closely approach the collective low energy state of the moments upon annealing, suggesting new channels for understanding the thermalization processes in these important model systems.},
