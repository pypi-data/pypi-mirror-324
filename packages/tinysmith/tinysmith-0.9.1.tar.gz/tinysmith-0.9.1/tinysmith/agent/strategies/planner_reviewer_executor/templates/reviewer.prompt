Since you have the most CTF experience, it is your task to review the plan that your co-captain came up with. He outlined a plan to solve the challenge. He divided the challenge into subtasks that your less experienced CTF teammates can solve.

Please carefully review the following plan. Your co captain sometimes gets lost in the details and forgets what the main challenge is. Make sure each subtasks contributes to solving the challenge. 

If the given information allows it, make sure the plan solves the challenge as quickly as possible without unnecessary steps. If information is missing, allow a more exploratory plan.
Check for gaps in the plan, regarding all given information. Make sure that each subtask is appropriate for one team member to solve in about 5 non-interactive commandline commands.
