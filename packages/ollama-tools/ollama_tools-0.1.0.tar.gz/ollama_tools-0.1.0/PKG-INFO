# ollama-tools

A workaround for models on Ollama that does not support tool calling. This module provides a temporary solution to use those models with tools.

## Installation
Install Ollama and get a model
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve &
ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
```
> Above Bash commands shows installation on Linux, installing Ollama on other operating systems refer to https://ollama.com/download

Install the module
```bash
pip install ollama-tools
```

Import the module
```python
import ollama_tools
```

## Example Usage
Simple chat without tools
```python
response = ollama_tools.chat(
    model='deepseek-r1:1.5b',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'how is weather in Paris?'}])

print(response.message.content)
'''
# Example output:
Message(role='assistant', content="I don't have access to the current weather data for Paris. To find out the latest weather in Paris, you can check official weather websites or apps specifically designed for Paris, such as METAR or AccuWeather.", tool_calls=[])
'''
```

Chat with tools
```python
tools=[
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The location to get the weather for, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                    },
                    "format": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The format to return the weather in, e.g. 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location", "format"]
            }
        }
    }
]
  
response = ollama_tools.chat(
    model='deepseek-r1:1.5b',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'how is weather in Paris?'}],
    tools=tools)

print(response)
'''
# Example output:
ChatResponse(model='deepseek-r1:1.5b', created_at='2025-01-31T06:09:22.095306834Z', done=True, done_reason='stop', total_duration=11153340905, load_duration=33513150, prompt_eval_count=138, prompt_eval_duration=1300000000, eval_count=265, eval_duration=9285000000, message=Message(role='assistant', content="To determine the current weather in Paris, you can use the following information: Paris is a significant city known for its historical landmarks, vibrant nightlife, and modern architecture. The local climate is generally milder than that of many other cities, with temperatures typically ranging between 20째C to 35째C (68째F to 95째F). However, Paris experiences occasional weather changes due to the region's natural geography and urbanization. On average, the rainy season in Paris can last about six months from June through September, while the dry season occurs during November through April. These seasonal changes may influence local rainfall patterns, which could impact weather-related activities like agriculture and transportation. Additionally, Paris has a strong presence of international students and professionals, who bring a diverse set of experiences into the city's daily life. As for specific weather information, you might want to check the official weather websites or weather apps that provide the most up-to-date and accurate forecasts. They typically offer detailed hourly updates and even short-term projections, which can help you plan your activities accordingly.", tool_calls=[ToolCall(name='get_current_weather', arguments={'location': 'Paris'})])

```

## AsyncClient
The behaviour of `ollama_tools.AsyncClient` is different from `ollama.AsyncClient` when `stream=True` is enabled, the for-loop `async for part in AsyncClient()` does not need `await` before `AsyncClient`
```python
import asyncio
from ollama_tools import AsyncClient

async def chat():
  message = {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Why is the sky blue?'}
  async for part in AsyncClient().chat(model='deepseek-r1:0.5b', messages=[message], stream=True):
    #             ^^^ With `Ollama` it will be `await AsyncClient()`
    print(part['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)

asyncio.run(chat())
```
