# Bakesite

A refreshingly simple static site/blog generator. 

Markdown in. HTML out.

### Yet Another Static Site Generator

While I used both Jekyll, Pelican and Hugo for different iterations of my personal blog, I always felt the solution to the simple problem of static site building was over-engineered.

If you look into the code bases of any other aforementioned projects, understanding, altering or contributing back is a daunting task. 

Why did it have to be so complicated? And how hard could it be to build?
