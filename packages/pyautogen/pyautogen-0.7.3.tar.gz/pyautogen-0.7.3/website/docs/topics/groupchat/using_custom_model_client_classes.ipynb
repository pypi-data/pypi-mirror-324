    "During a group chat using the `auto` speaker selection method, an inner conversation between two agents is created to determine the next speaker after each turn. One of the speakers will take the `llm_config` from the `GroupChatManager` (the other inner agent doesn't use an `llm_config`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the configuration for the GroupChatManager is using a Custom Model Client Class this is not propagated through to the inner conversation.\n",

    "- **select_speaker_auto_model_client_cls**: Set this to the class of your custom model client\n",

      "In your case, you'll want to use the Full Amortization Method (also known as Straight-Line Depreciation) to depreciate the equipment over its useful life. This method assumes that the equipment will be used for a certain number of years, and you'll depreciate it evenly over that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), you should capitalize the full purchase price of the equipment, which is $100,000. This includes both the cash outlay ($50,000) and the financing portion ($50,000).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GAAP requires capitalization**: When an asset is purchased or constructed, it must be capitalized in its entirety, regardless of how it was financed.\n",
      "2. **The equipment has a useful life**: Since you'll be using the equipment for multiple years to produce goods, it will have a useful life beyond the initial year. This means that the entire purchase price should be recognized as an asset on your balance sheet.\n",
      "3. **Depreciation will be calculated based on the total cost**: You'll depreciate the equipment over its useful life, using the straight-line method. The depreciation expense will be calculated based on the total cost of the equipment, including both the cash outlay and the financed portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assume the equipment has a useful life of 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Total cost: $100,000\n",
      "* Annual depreciation expense = ($100,000 ÷ 5) = $20,000 per year\n",
      "\n",
      "In each of the 5 years, you'll record an annual depreciation expense of $20,000, which will be calculated based on the total cost of the equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, capitalize the full $100,000 purchase price of the equipment, and depreciate it over its useful life using the straight-line method. This ensures that your accounting records accurately reflect the economic reality of owning an asset with a finite useful life.\n",

      "\n",
      "To illustrate this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assume the same equipment with a $100,000 purchase price and a 6% interest rate on the financed portion ($50,000). The interest expense for each year would be calculated as follows:\n",
