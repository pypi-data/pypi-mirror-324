Changelog
#########

When you make **any** change to this repository it **MUST** be accompanied by a changelog file.
The changelog for this repository uses the `towncrier <https://github.com/twisted/towncrier>`__ package.
Entries in the changelog for the next release are added as individual files (one per change) to the ``changelog/`` directory.

Writing a Changelog Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A changelog entry accompanying a change should be added to the ``changelog/`` directory.
The name of a file in this directory follows a specific template::

  <PULL REQUEST NUMBER>.<TYPE>[.<COUNTER>].rst

The fields have the following meanings:

* ``<PULL REQUEST NUMBER>``: This is the number of the pull request, so people can jump from the changelog entry to the diff on BitBucket.
* ``<TYPE>``: This is the type of the change and must be one of the values described below.
* ``<COUNTER>``: This is an optional field, if you make more than one change of the same type you can append a counter to the subsequent changes, i.e. ``100.bugfix.rst`` and ``100.bugfix.1.rst`` for two bugfix changes in the same PR.

The list of possible types is defined the the towncrier section of ``pyproject.toml``, the types are:

* ``feature``: This change is a new code feature.
* ``bugfix``: This is a change which fixes a bug.
* ``doc``: A documentation change.
* ``removal``: A deprecation or removal of public API.
* ``misc``: Any small change which doesn't fit anywhere else, such as a change to the package infrastructure.


Rendering the Changelog at Release Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are about to tag a release first you must run ``towncrier`` to render the changelog.
The steps for this are as follows:

* Run `towncrier build --version vx.y.z` using the version number you want to tag.
* Agree to have towncrier remove the fragments.
* Add and commit your changes.
* Tag the release.

**NOTE:** If you forget to add a Changelog entry to a tagged release (either manually or automatically with ``towncrier``)
then the Bitbucket pipeline will fail. To be able to use the same tag you must delete it locally and on the remote branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    # First, actually update the CHANGELOG and commit the update
    git commit

    # Delete tags
    git tag -d vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION
    git push --delete origin vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION

    # Re-tag with the same version
    git tag vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION
    git push --tags origin main
