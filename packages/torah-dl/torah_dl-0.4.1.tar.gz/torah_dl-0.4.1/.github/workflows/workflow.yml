# GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
# You can create workflows that run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, or that deploy merged pull requests to production.
# For more information, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
