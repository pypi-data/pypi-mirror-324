# Dependabot is a tool that helps you keep your dependencies up to date.
# It automatically checks for updates to the dependencies you are using in your project.
# When it finds an update, it creates a pull request with the updated dependency.
# This helps ensure that your project is using the latest versions of its dependencies,
# which can include important security fixes, performance improvements, and new features.
# Dependabot can be configured to check for updates on a regular schedule and can be
# customized to fit the needs of your project.
