Use Cases / Context
===================

In businesses, especially those in services or consulting, where
expenses may be incurred on behalf of a client but later need to be
reimbursed by the client, Odoo’s functionality for
``Re-Invoice Expenses`` products (without using the hr_expenses module)
lacks visibility of this information in the project dashboard.

With this module, two sections are added to the project dashboard:

- **Provisions**: Values invoiced to the client in advance to cover any
  necessary expenses. This section displays the analytic entries
  generated from customer invoices for specific products.
- **Reimbursements cost:** Values generated from vendor bills that need
  to be charged to the client. Using Odoo’s functionality, these are the
  sales order lines automatically created from a vendor bill when the
  product is configured as ``Re-Invoice Expenses``.

Configuration
=============

**To automatically create a project from a sale order:**

- Go to ``Sales > Products > Products``.
- Create a new product with the following options:

  - Product Type: Service
  - Invoicing Policy: ``Prepaid/Fixed Price``.
  - Create on Order: Set an option other than ``Nothing``.

**For Provisions:**

- Go to ``Sales > Products > Products``.
- Create a new product of type Service.

**For Reimbursement:**

- Go to ``Sales > Products > Products``.
- Create a new product with the following options:

  - ``Product Type``: Service
  - Invoicing Policy: ``Based on Delivered Quantity (Manual)``.
  - ``Re-Invoice Expenses``: At cost or Sales price
  - Fill in the ``Provision Product`` field created in the previous
    step.

Usage
=====

**To generate a new project from a sale order**:

- Go to ``Sales > Orders > Quotations``.
- Create a new sales order and select the first product configured.
- Add a second line with the second configured product for
  ``Provisions``.
- Confirm the sales order.
- Generated the invoice

**To generate reimbursement costs**:

- Go to ``Invoicing > Vendors > Bills``.
- Create a new bill and select the third product configured for
  ``Reimbursement``.
- In the invoice line, set the analytic distribution with the analytic
  account for the project.
- Confirm the bill, and a new line will be added to the sale order with
  the reimbursement cost.
- While the provision has a remaining amount, a new line will be added
  to the sale order with the product for Provisions, but with a negative
  quantity.

**Project status dashboard**:

- Go to ``Project > Projects``.
- Search for the respective project.
- In the Kanban view, click the top-right icon to display project
  settings, then click ``Reporting / Project Updates``.
