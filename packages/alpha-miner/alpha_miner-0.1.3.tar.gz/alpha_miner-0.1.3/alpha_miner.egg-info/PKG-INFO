The alpha-miner package implements the α-algorithm, a foundational method in process mining developed by van der Aalst, Weijters, and Măruşter.This algorithm analyzes event logs—collections of activity sequences—to infer causal (Discovery Limitations: Loops of Length 1 or 2, Faulty petri nets due to non-required implicit places, Missing local dependencies, Bias.) See: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1316839.relationships between activities. It also outputs a resulting petri net.
