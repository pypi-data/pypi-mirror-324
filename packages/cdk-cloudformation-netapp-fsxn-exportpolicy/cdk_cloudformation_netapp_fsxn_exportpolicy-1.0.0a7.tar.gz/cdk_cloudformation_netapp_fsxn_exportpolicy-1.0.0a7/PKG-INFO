Summary: An export policy defines a set of access rules for NFS clients, specifying which clients or networks can access a volume and with what permissions. Each volume is tied to an export policy which enforces these rules to control client access and provide security and management over FSx for ONTAP volumes. Once activated, you will need a preview key to consume this resource. Please reach out to Ng-fsx-cloudformation@netapp.com to get the key. To use this resource, you would need to first create the Link module.

# netapp-fsxn-exportpolicy

> AWS CDK [L1 construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html) and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html) type `NetApp::FSxN::ExportPolicy` v1.0.0.

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name NetApp::FSxN::ExportPolicy \
  --publisher-id a25d267c2b9b86b8d408fce3c7a4d94d34c90946 \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/a25d267c2b9b86b8d408fce3c7a4d94d34c90946/NetApp-FSxN-ExportPolicy \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

You can find more information about activating this type in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).
