Precise identification of T cell antigen is crucial for the development of cancer mRNA vaccine. However, existing computational methods identify the interaction between antigen and Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) or T cell receptor (TCR) only at the sequence or residue level, which fails to capture atom-level binding patterns. In this study, we innovatively transformed each residue sequence into a topological graph, in which each node corresponds to an atom and each edge corresponds to chemical bond, and then proposed a graph convolutional network framework, called deepAntigen, to identify the interactions between antigens and TCR/HLA at the atom level. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, deepAntigen achieves the best performance in identifying antigens presented by HLA and recognized by TCR. Importantly, deepAntigen can discovery antigen-specific TCR motifs and capture the mutation effect on T cell immune response, facilitating to decipher underlying binding mechanism. Overall, we provide a novel method named deepAntigen for accurately identifying T cell antigens, which will contribute to the development of personalized neoantigen-targeted immunotherapies for cancer patients.
## How to install deepAntigen
To install deepAntigen, make sure you have installed [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you need more details on the dependences, look at the environment.yml file.

- set up conda environment for deepAntigen
```shell
conda create -n deepAntigen-env python=3.8
```

- install deepAntigen from shell
```shell
pip install deepAntigen
pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-cluster==1.5.9 torch-scatter==2.0.7 torch-sparse==0.6.12 torch-spline-conv==1.2.1 -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.9.0%2Bcu111.html
pip install torch-geometric==2.4.0
```

## How to import deepAntigen
Using deepAntigen to achieve different tasks, please import corresponding module to your jupyter notebooks or scripts. 

If you want to predict antigen-HLAI binding at the sequence level, 
```python
from deepantigen.antigenHLAI import run_antigenHLAI_seq
```
If you want to predict atom-level contact between antigen and HLAI, 
```python
from deepantigen.antigenHLAI import run_antigenHLAI_atom
```

If you want to predict antigen-HLAII binding at the sequence level, 
```python
from deepantigen.antigenHLAII import run_antigenHLAII_seq
```
If you want to predict atom-level contact between antigen and HLAII, 
```python
from deepantigen.antigenHLAII import run_antigenHLAII_atom
```

If you want to predict antigen-TCR binding at the sequence level, 
```python
from deepantigen.antigenTCR import run_antigenTCR_seq
```
If you want to predict atom-level contact between antigen and TCR,
```python
from deepantigen.antigenTCR import run_antigenTCR_atom
```
## How to run deepAntigen for antigen-HLAI binding prediction
For sequence-level prediction, please prepare your antigen-HLAI data and place them in a .csv file format similar to the test_antigenHLAI/sequence/test.csv provided. The column 'label' is optional. 
```python
df = run_antigenHLAI_seq.Inference(path)
```
The returned DataFrame, `df`, is prediction results of deepAntigen, which includes the binding probability for each antigen-HLAI pair. 
For atom-level prediction, please prepare your antigen-HLAI data and place them in a .csv file format similar to the test_antigenHLAI/crystal_structure/sample.csv provided.
```python
peptide_atoms, HLAI_atoms, contact_maps = run_antigenHLAI_atom.Inference(path)
```
The returned three lists correspond top-_k_ atoms of the peptide, top-_k_ atoms of the HLAI and atom-level contact probability. Each element in `peptide_atoms` or`HLAI_atoms`  is a list with length of _k_. Each element in `contact_maps` is a _k*k_ DataFrame.

If you want to train deepAntigen with your own antigen-HLAI binding data, please reference the detailed [Documentaion](#VCGRP) about deepAntigen.
