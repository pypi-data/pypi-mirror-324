        Upserts the Object to the Object Store.

        This creates the Object if it does not exist, or replaces its contents entirely
        if it does exist. This is schemaless. If you want to specify the ID at creation
        time, you must use this PUT instead of the POST, because the POST endpoint
        creates an ID.

        Returns an empty JSON object (`{}`). Sets the 'Location' HTTP response header to
        the URL of the upserted Object.

        This is an asynchronous operation.

        ## Examples

        When upserting objects, it is important to explicitly set the `id` field in your
        request. If no `id` is set the upsert endpoint will also generate a unique ID
        for the Object. The `id` field is used to match the Object to the existing
        Object in the Object Store.

        In these examples, we'll be using `bash` commands. But they should be adaptable
        to any programming language.

        ### Upserting a single Object

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
        OBJECT_ID='sku_123456'
        OBJECT='{"name": "White T-Shirt", "color": "white", "size": "medium", "price": 10.99}'

        curl -X PUT   "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$OBJECT_ID"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d "$OBJECT"
        ```

        ### Upserting multiple Objects from JSON data with existing IDs

        Often times your data will already have an ID field. In this case, you can use
        your existing ID field to upsert the Object to the Object Store. In this
        example, we will use the `product_id` field as the `id` for upserting the
        Objects. For this to work, you'll want to make sure your system has
        [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed.

        ```bash
        API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        # JSON data containing multiple objects
        JSON_DATA='[
            {"product_id": "sku_123456", "name": "White T-Shirt", "color": "white", "size": "medium", "price": 10.99},
            {"product_id": "sku_123457", "name": "Black T-Shirt", "color": "black", "size": "large", "price": 11.99}
        ]'

        # Loop through each object in the JSON array
        echo "$JSON_DATA" | jq -c '.[]' | while read -r object; do
            # Extract the id from the object
            id=$(echo "$object" | jq -r '.product_id')

            # Make the curl request
            response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT         "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$id"         -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d "$object")
        done
        ```

        ### Batch Upserting Objects from JSON data

        Building on the previous example, this one downloads a JSON file with 10,000
        objects and upserts them to the Object Store in parallel.

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
        # Download JSON data from the provided URL
        JSON_DATA=$(curl -s https://d11p8vtjlacpl4.cloudfront.net/demos/ecommerce/hm-10k.json)

        # Check if the download was successful
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            exit 1
        fi

        process_object() {
            local object="$1"
            id=$(echo "$object" | jq -r '.article_id')
            status_code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT         "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$id"         -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d "$object")
            if [ "$status_code" != "202" ]; then
                echo "Error processing object $id: Status code $status_code"
            fi
        }

        export -f process_object
        export API_KEY

        # Process objects in parallel, 100 at a time

        Upserts the Object to the Object Store.

        This creates the Object if it does not exist, or replaces its contents entirely
        if it does exist. This is schemaless. If you want to specify the ID at creation
        time, you must use this PUT instead of the POST, because the POST endpoint
        creates an ID.

        Returns an empty JSON object (`{}`). Sets the 'Location' HTTP response header to
        the URL of the upserted Object.

        This is an asynchronous operation.

        ## Examples

        When upserting objects, it is important to explicitly set the `id` field in your
        request. If no `id` is set the upsert endpoint will also generate a unique ID
        for the Object. The `id` field is used to match the Object to the existing
        Object in the Object Store.

        In these examples, we'll be using `bash` commands. But they should be adaptable
        to any programming language.

        ### Upserting a single Object

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
        OBJECT_ID='sku_123456'
        OBJECT='{"name": "White T-Shirt", "color": "white", "size": "medium", "price": 10.99}'

        curl -X PUT   "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$OBJECT_ID"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d "$OBJECT"
        ```

        ### Upserting multiple Objects from JSON data with existing IDs

        Often times your data will already have an ID field. In this case, you can use
        your existing ID field to upsert the Object to the Object Store. In this
        example, we will use the `product_id` field as the `id` for upserting the
        Objects. For this to work, you'll want to make sure your system has
        [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed.

        ```bash
        API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        # JSON data containing multiple objects
        JSON_DATA='[
            {"product_id": "sku_123456", "name": "White T-Shirt", "color": "white", "size": "medium", "price": 10.99},
            {"product_id": "sku_123457", "name": "Black T-Shirt", "color": "black", "size": "large", "price": 11.99}
        ]'

        # Loop through each object in the JSON array
        echo "$JSON_DATA" | jq -c '.[]' | while read -r object; do
            # Extract the id from the object
            id=$(echo "$object" | jq -r '.product_id')

            # Make the curl request
            response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT         "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$id"         -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d "$object")
        done
        ```

        ### Batch Upserting Objects from JSON data

        Building on the previous example, this one downloads a JSON file with 10,000
        objects and upserts them to the Object Store in parallel.

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
        # Download JSON data from the provided URL
        JSON_DATA=$(curl -s https://d11p8vtjlacpl4.cloudfront.net/demos/ecommerce/hm-10k.json)

        # Check if the download was successful
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            exit 1
        fi

        process_object() {
            local object="$1"
            id=$(echo "$object" | jq -r '.article_id')
            status_code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT         "https://api.objective.inc/v1/objects/$id"         -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d "$object")
            if [ "$status_code" != "202" ]; then
                echo "Error processing object $id: Status code $status_code"
            fi
        }

        export -f process_object
        export API_KEY

        # Process objects in parallel, 100 at a time
