# okcourse

The `okcourse` Python library creates audiobook-style courses with lectures on any topic by using text completion, text-to-speech, and image AI models to generate course content.

The cover art features a stylized illustration of a Commodore 64 and components and misspelled words resembling the selected track's name, 'Commodore 64 Assembly Programming with KickAssembler and VICE,' which is 3 hours, 14 minutes, and 51 seconds long.][media-player-01]

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://python.org)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) set in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Installation

### Install from PyPi

Use `pip`, `uv`, Poetry, or another package manager to install the `okcourse` package from PyPi.

For example, to  install the package with `pip`:

```sh
# Install okcourse package from PyPi (recommended)
pip install okcourse
```

### Install from GitHub

I recommend installing from PyPi as described above. You can, however, install the latest (possibly busted) version of the library directly from the `main` branch of the GitHub repo by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
# Install okcourse directly from GitHub
uv add git+https://github.com/mmacy/okcourse.git # (1)!
```

1. Installing directly from the tip of a GitHub repo's default branch is like installing a nightly dev build and can also be considered risky from a security standpointâ€”[caveat emptor](https://www.findlaw.com/consumer/consumer-transactions/what-does-caveat-emptor-mean-.html).

## Generate a course

A complete "course" has five components: title, outline, lectures, cover art, and audio file.

To generate an outline, you provide a title. Once you've generated the outline, you can generate the lectures, cover art, and audio.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Title] --> B[Outline]
    B --> C[Lectures]
    C --> D[Cover]
    D --> E[Audio]
```

At a minimum, import [`Course`][okcourse.Course] and a generator, like [`OpenAIAsyncGenerator`][okcourse.OpenAIAsyncGenerator], and you can start generating courses.

```python
import asyncio
from okcourse import Course, OpenAIAsyncGenerator

async def main() -> None:
    """Use the OpenAIAsyncGenerator to generate a complete course."""

    # Create a course, configure its settings, and initialize the generator
    course = Course(title="From AGI to ASI: Paperclips, Gray Goo, and You")
    generator = OpenAIAsyncGenerator(course)

    # Generate all course content - these call the AI model provider's API
    course = await generator.generate_outline(course)
    course = await generator.generate_lectures(course)
    course = await generator.generate_image(course)
    course = await generator.generate_audio(course)

    # The course should now be populated with an outline, lectures, and
    # links to its cover image (PNG) and audio (MP3) files.

    # The 'Course' object is a Pydantic model, as are its nested models,
    # so they support (de)serialization out of the box. For example, you
    # can print the course in JSON format to the console with Pydantic's
    # BaseModel.model_dump_json() method:
    print(course.model_dump_json(indent=2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The previous code snippet demonstrates generating a course from only a title, but there are several other settings available for tuning course generation.

[`CourseSettings`][okcourse.CourseSettings] lets you configure the number of lectures, number of subtopics in each lecture, and which AI models to use for generating the course content (lecture text, cover image, and audio file).

## Run an example app

To see the library in action, try generating a course by running an [example app](/okcourse/examples/).

For example, if you've installed [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), run the CLI script with `uv run`:

```sh
uv run examples/cli_example_async.py
```

Output from a successful course generation with `cli_example_async.py` and default settings looks similar to the following:

```console
$ uv run examples/cli_example_async.py

*BEHOLD!* A four-lecture audio course about Artificial Super Intelligence by Artificial Not-So-Super Intelligence, with AI-generated album art complete with misspellings (the two **I**s in *SERIIES* are for a double dose of intelligence, I'm guessing):
