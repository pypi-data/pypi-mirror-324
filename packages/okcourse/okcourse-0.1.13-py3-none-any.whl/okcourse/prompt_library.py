"""A collection of prompt sets for different types of courses.

To steer the AI models in creating a specific type or style of course, you assign a
[`CoursePromptSet`][okcourse.models.CoursePromptSet] to a course's
[`CourseSettings.prompts`][okcourse.CourseSettings.prompts] attribute.

The [`ACADEMIC`][okcourse.prompt_library.ACADEMIC] prompt set is the default used by the course generators in the
`okcourse` library, but you can use (or create!) any set that includes the same replaceable tokens as those found in the
[`ACADEMIC`][okcourse.prompt_library.ACADEMIC] and [`GAME_MASTER`][okcourse.prompt_library.GAME_MASTER] prompts.

The style or type of "course" you create with a set of prompts need not actually resemble a typical college lecture
series format. For example, the [`GAME_MASTER`][okcourse.prompt_library.GAME_MASTER] prompt set generates something much
closer to a story-like audiobook, whose "lectures" are the chapters in the book.

Typical usage example:

The following example creates a course object with settings that specify the course generator should use the prompts in
the [`GAME_MASTER`][okcourse.prompt_library.GAME_MASTER] prompt set when generating the course's outline, lectures
(or chapters, in this case), and cover art.

```python
from okcourse import Course, CourseSettings
from okcourse.prompt_library import GAME_MASTER

course_settings = CourseSettings(prompts=GAME_MASTER)
course = Course(settings=course_settings)
```
