We are bulding a Nextjs like framework for organizing data and pipelines.
I want to build a framework in python with a CLI, that initializes a "Next Data" project.
Next Data is an opinionated way to structure data and data pipelines, using file based routing and file naming conventions.
Each "data route" should automatically create an S3 Table.
It should be easy to write transformations that automatically run on an Amazon EMR cluster and write to new tables.
There should be an accompanying web app with a UI that automatically shows data schemas and dependencies
After each session, update the .cursorrules file with the new changes. Keep track of requirements and open TODOs.

# Requirements

- [ ] A data directory that corresponds to each data source
- [ ] A dashboard that shows data schemas and dependencies
- [ ] Drag and drop UI in the dashboard for creating new data routes and uploading data
- [ ] A CLI (ndx) for creating a new Next Data project
- [ ] A connections directory that contains all the connections to external data sources
- [ ] File name conventions for common patterns like etl, retl, etc.
- [ ] An NdxContext that builds a typed object model for the data and available connections, making it easy to read data and write transformations to external data sources
- [ ] @local and @remote decorators to easily run scripts either locally or on an EMR cluster
- [ ] Use Pulumi to manage AWS resources

# TODOs

- [ ] Create a CLI for creating a new Next Data project
- [ ] Add template files
- [ ] Add a dashboard for viewing data schemas and dependencies
- [ ] Add file listener that automatically creates new tables when new files are added to the data directory
