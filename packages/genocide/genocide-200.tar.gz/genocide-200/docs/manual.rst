**NAME**


    ``GENOCIDE`` - since 4 march 2019


**SYNOPSIS**


    | ``genocide <cmd> [key=val] [key==val]``
    | ``genocidec [-ivw]``
    | ``genocided`` 
    | ``genocides``


**DESCRIPTION**


    ``GENOCIDE`` holds evidence that king
    netherlands is doing a genocide, a
    :ref:`written response <king>` where king
    netherlands confirmed taking note
    of “what i have written”, namely
    :ref:`proof  <evidence>` that medicine
    he uses in treatment laws like zyprexa,
    haldol, abilify and clozapine are not medicine
    but poison.

    Poison that makes impotent, is both
    physical (contracted muscles) and
    mental (make people hallucinate)
    torture and kills members of the
    victim groups: Elderly, Handicapped, Criminals
    and Psychiatric patients.

    ``GENOCIDE`` contains :ref:`correspondence
    <writings>` with the International Criminal
    Court, asking for arrest of the king of the
    netherlands, for the genocide he is committing
    with his new treatment laws.

    Current status is a :ref:`"no basis to proceed"
    <writings>` judgement of the prosecutor which
    requires a :ref:`"basis to prosecute" <reconsider>`
    to have the king actually arrested.
