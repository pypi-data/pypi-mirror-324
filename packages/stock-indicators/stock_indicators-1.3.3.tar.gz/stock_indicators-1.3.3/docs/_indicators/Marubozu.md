><span class="indicator-syntax">**get_marubozu**(*quotes, min_body_percent=95*)</span>

## Parameters

| name | type | notes
| -- |-- |--
| `quotes` | Iterable[Quote] | Iterable of the [Quote class]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) or [its sub-class]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#using-custom-quote-classes). <br><span class='qna-dataframe'> â€¢ [See here]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#using-pandasdataframe) for usage with pandas.DataFrame</span>
| `min_body_percent` | float, *default 95* | Optional.  Minimum body size as a percent of total candle size.  Example: 85% would be entered as 85 (not 0.85).  Must be between 80 and 100, if specified.

### Historical quotes requirements

You must have at least one historical quote; however, more is typically provided since this is a chartable candlestick pattern.

`quotes` is an `Iterable[Quote]` collection of historical price quotes.  It should have a consistent frequency (day, hour, minute, etc).  See [the Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guide/#historical-quotes) for more information.

## Return

```python
CandleResults[CandleResult]
```

- This method returns a time series of all available indicator values for the `quotes` provided.
- `CandleResults` is just a list of `CandleResult`.
- It always returns the same number of elements as there are in the historical quotes.
- It does not return a single incremental indicator value.
- The candlestick pattern is indicated on dates where `match` is `Match.BULL_SIGNAL` or `Match.BEAR_SIGNAL`.
- `price` is `close` price; however, all OHLC elements are included in the `candle` properties.
- There is no intrinsic basis or confirmation Match provided for this pattern.
