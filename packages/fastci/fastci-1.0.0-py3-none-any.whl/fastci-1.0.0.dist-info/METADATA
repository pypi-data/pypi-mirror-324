# FastCI

FastCI is a lightweight, efficient and developer-friendly communication
interface, enabling seamless communication between distributed systems.
By leveraging MQTT for messaging and Protocol Buffers for data serialization,
this interface ensures fast, reliable, and bandwidth-efficient communication.
Its simplicity in setup and development makes it ideal for both small-scale
and enterprise-level applications.
