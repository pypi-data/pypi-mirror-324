```

---

## üõ† Usage

### Read Last `number_of_lines: int` Lines
This function allows you to read the last n lines from the log
```python
from t6logreader import T6LogReader

log_reader = T6LogReader()
print(log_reader.read_last_lines(number_of_lines=10))
```

----

### Search for a Specific `command: str`
Searches for commands like "kick", "ban", etc. You can customize the prefix
```python
from t6logreader import T6LogReader

log_reader = T6LogReader()
print(log_reader.search_command(command="kick", prefix="")) # Prefix is normally set as "]" 
```

----

### Read the Last Line
Reads the most recent line from the log file
```python
from t6logreader import T6LogReader

log_reader = T6LogReader()
print(log_reader.read_last_line()) 
```

---

### Clear the Log File
```python
from t6logreader import T6LogReader

log_reader = T6LogReader()
log_reader.clear_log()
```

---

### Count occurrences of a `keyword: str` | `prefix: str`
Counts how many times a keyword (e.g., "kick") appears in the log.
```python
from t6logreader import T6LogReader

log_reader = T6LogReader()
print(log_reader.count_occurences(keyword="kick", prefix="]"))
```

---

## üìÇ File Path Handling

#### By default, it reads:
```
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Plutonium\console.log
```

#### But you can specify a custom path:
```python
log_reader = T6LogReader(log_path="custom/path/to/console.log")
```
