## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. PyPI Release
   - Set up PyPI account
   - Create API token
   - Test deployment
   - Update documentation

2. Package Distribution Enhancement
   - Create release process
   - Add version management
   - Update installation guides

3. Post-Release Tasks
   - Monitor package health
   - Gather user feedback
   - Plan next features
