    r"""Explicit matrix exponentiation to compute propagators.

    Explicitly batch-compute the propagators for all time intervals in `tsave`. These
    propagators are then iteratively applied:

    - starting from the initial state for [`dq.sesolve()`][dynamiqs.sesolve] and
      [`dq.mesolve()`][dynamiqs.mesolve], to compute states for all times in `tsave`,
    - starting from the identity matrix for [`dq.sepropagator()`][dynamiqs.sepropagator]
      and [`dq.mepropagator()`][dynamiqs.mepropagator], to compute propagators for all
      times in `tsave`.

    For the Schr√∂dinger equation with constant Hamiltonian $H$, the propagator from
    time $t_0$ to time $t_1$ is an $n\times n$ matrix given by
    $$
        U(t_0, t_1) = \exp(-i (t_1 - t_0) H).
    $$

    For the Lindblad master equation with constant Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, the
    problem is vectorized and the propagator from time $t_0$ to time $t_1$ is an
    $n^2\times n^2$ matrix given by
    $$
        \mathcal{U}(t_0, t_1) = \exp((t_1 - t_0)\mathcal{L}).
    $$

    Warning:
        If the Hamiltonian or jump operators are sparse qarrays, they will be silently
        converted to dense qarrays before computing their matrix exponentials.

    Warning:
        This solver is not recommended for open systems of large dimension, due to
        the $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ scaling of computing the Liouvillian exponential.

    Warning:
        This solver only supports constant or piecewise constant Hamiltonian and jump
        operators.
