Speedups
--------

tox-faster implements these tox speedups:

### Disables tox's dependency listing (the "env report")

Every single time you run tox it runs `pip freeze` to print out a list of all
the packages installed in the testenv being run:

<pre><code>tox -e lint
<b>lint installed: aiohttp==3.8.1,aioresponses==0.7.3,aiosignal==1.2.0,
alembic==1.8.0,amqp==5.1.1,astroid==2.11.6,async-timeout==4.0.1,attrs==20.2.0,
...</b>
lint run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='2115099637'
lint run-test: commands[0] | pylint lms bin
...</code></pre>

You don't need to see that in your terminal every time you run tox and if your
venv contains a lot of packages it's quite annoying because it prints
screenfulls of text. Running `pip freeze` also introduces a noticeable delay in
the startup time of every tox command: on my machine with my venv it adds about
250ms.

You can hide this output by running tox with `-q` but that doesn't make tox run
any faster: it seems that it still runs the `pip freeze` even though it doesn't
print it.

tox-faster actually prevents tox from running `pip freeze` so your tox output
will be shorter and your tox commands will start faster:

```terminal
$ tox -e lint
lint run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3084948731'
lint run-test: commands[0] | pylint lms bin
...
```

**tox-faster doesn't disable the env report on CI.**
The env report can be useful diagnostic information on CI so if an environment
variable named `CI` is set to any value then tox-faster won't disable the env report.
This also enables you to re-enable the env report locally by running
`CI=true tox ...`.
