# cloud evaluator

this example shows how to run a simple test with the `CloudEvaluator`

using the cloud evaluator gives you a link to the call analysis performed by fixa-observe

```bash
üéØ order_donut (jessica)
üîä Recording URL: https://api.twilio.com/XXX
üîó fixa-observe call analysis: https://www.fixa.dev/observe/calls/XXX
-- ‚ùå price_confirmed: Agent did not confirm the price for the donuts and coffee order.
-- ‚úÖ order_success: Agent successfully confirmed the order of a dozen donuts and a coffee.
```

fixa-observe comes with an audio player, a transcript, and pinpoints where the evaluations failed. it also analyzes latency and interruptions.

the call analysis UI looks like this:
